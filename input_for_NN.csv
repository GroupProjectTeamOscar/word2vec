ihatethecold,Wed 01-Mar-17 06:24:02,"We went to camhs with my 13 year old dd last year for anxiety. It was so bad she wasn't eating for 18 hours a day. School and severe bullying caused her to feel so bad. Our referral took about 10 weeks. They said they couldn't help because she wasn't self harming, suicidal or psychotic. They are so stretched that you have to be really unwell before they could help. That doesn't mean your area is as stretched as mine but just to make you aware. We have found counselling through the school and looked for privately funded cbt. I would approach your child's school and ask them to help you. It might happen a lot quicker. Good luck."
Pleasehelp17,Sun 26-Feb-17 11:08:45,"Posted this in chat last night but also posting here for anymore help and advice.I don't even know where to start. 16 year old ds has Aspergers, ODD and anxiety... our relationship is pretty much non exsistent nowadays, he has completely shut me out and I'm desperate to help him but I don't know how to help or where else to turn as help we have been offered in the past he won't co-operate with. He's violent with me and his siblings, he has smashed his bedroom up several times in rages, smashed 3 TVs in the last few months. His verbal abuse is out of control, he says the most disgusting things to us, his family, calls us vile names it really is horrendous. He was in mainstream school till sept last year where he refused to go back as he couldn't cope there, has no friends and was being picked on, he then spent the the next 5 months pretty much shut away in his bedroom with his phone and PlayStation, he is obsessed with talking to girls on social media, he gets fixated on about 3 different girls a weeks and will swing from high to low moods.. he doesn't open up much to me but he has told me he will be speaking to a girl and after a couple of days she will block him and he will be depressed, moody, verbally abusive to myself and his siblings till he fixates on another girl he'll be in a high mood and then history repeats itself and it's just a cycle of ups and downs. He is desperately searching for a girlfriend, doesn't matter who it is anyone will do but he hasn't got a clue how to speak to people or how to act around them as he doesn't socialise and he doesn't have ANY friends. He has now been at a new 'school' for 3 weeks now which is for children with special needs. He has arrested twice now due to his violence but nothing ever seems to change, social workers, youth workers, counsellors etc have all tried working with him and he just point blank refuses to engage with them, he's completely in his own bubble and won't let anyone in. Last time he got arrested was 2 weeks ago, he got bailed to his grandparents house and refused to speak to me for a week, was sending me message saying he was going to kill himself. I'm absolutely worried sick about him, I'm not sleeping at night.. I have no clue how to parent him, he doesn't want me to parent him! I'm terrified about his future, I don't see how he will lead a normal, adult life with him being the way he is. Sorry for rambling, has anyone got any advice please?"
inchoccyheaven,Fri 24-Feb-17 13:28:14,My ds also suffers from anxiety and low moods. He is also 14. It was triggered by me leaving my exh for someone else 3 yrs ago but isn't the cause of his anxiety etc now. He refused to go to school and was so depressed it was awful. He missed most of yr 8 and eventually got a place at hospital school where he has been ever since and will hopefully stay until he finishes his gcses.He is a lovely child who doesnt give me any problems but i worry about him very much because of the low moods and that he still misses quite a lot of schooling. I don't know how to help him and never know how he will be as he goes from being low and sleeping a lot to seeming to be fine and on the ps4 laughing and having fun.
IsMyVoodooWorking,Wed 25-Jan-17 17:51:01,"Oh how tough for you and your DD. I may not have much wisdom and I'm not sure how old your DD is but I was her and wasn't lucky enough to have a supportive parent like you. Who I did open up to was my older sister and what she did that helped me was not to press me. I found it hard to explain why I was feeling the way I did and it made me angry when people questioned me. She told me i didn't have to talk to her but that if I was self harming it was important to be safe- she didn't try to stop me or make me feel ashamed. It meant I didn't feel I had to hide as much and if I had taken a risk or felt I was going to do a lot of damage then I felt I could tell her and she wouldn't flip out or panic. I found her calmness to he really helpful, but it must have been so tough on her really. Its really great that she's been in touch with her GP, and school may be able to help. Hopefully CAMHS have come along since I was a teenager as I didn't find them helpful at all and they were very minimising of my self harm and suicidal feelings which is why having my sister was also so important to me. I'd suggest getting some support for yourself - YoungMinds have a parenting helpline and email http://www.youngminds.org.uk/for_parents/parent_helpline"
Scotslasslivinginfrance,Wed 25-Jan-17 20:33:41,https://headspace.org.au/health-professionals/understanding-self-harm-for-health-professionals/There is an app called Stay alive it's really good and informative for both those with suicidal idéations and for those who are worried about. It provides support to help keep you safe and tools to help keep you safe.The above link is also a valuable source of information.for you and make sure you get support for yourself
PhyllisDietrichson,Sun 05-Feb-17 16:14:24," Update. It's ups and downs. DDs self harm has progressed to arms as well as legs. So sad and (actually appalled) to hear she has to do it to 'stay alive' whilst we wait for CAMHS. BUT conversely, she has also had a laugh with us, come on walks, played board games, chatted about some of what's going on. There have been silent sullen days when shes come down in baggy dirty sweatshirts and greasy hair looking angry and scary. But im remaing as calm and loving as i can. Despite crying in the car after dropping her off and again wondering what on earth have i done / we done to mess this child up so much? She tells us it's not us, shes been depressed for years since a little girl and cited things like hitting herself even at primary school but having a happy childhood. It is difficult beyond measure to go through this knowing help is a month away because there just are not the facilities for anything sooner."
PhyllisDietrichson,Wed 08-Feb-17 08:46:51,"Update 2DD took a limited but mercifully inaffective overdose last night and then told us she'd done it. She also admitted to standing on 8th floor of a local carpark earlier in the day. We spent all night and half of today in A&E.A psych doc from the hospital team came spent just under an hour with her at 1am, then eventually a psych nurse from CAMHS came to see her the following afternoon 13-14 hours after admission but were unable to speed things up. They talked to her again and got the same details as: her GP and the local psych unit doc has, but it still a Psychiatrist she needs to see her in order to issue meds and assess her for talking therapies or indeed to admit her into a unit. So we just have to wait. DD has been chronically / clinically depressed for almost a month now. We could have gone down the private route too but nothing was available for our DD, in fact the private unit said her case was too severe for them because she'd gone beyond suicidal ideation. The psych nurse from CAMHS said her case was not severe enough because her suicide attempt was not serious enough. So DD fallen between the gulf created by private /NHS judgments about the severity of her need.This contrasts significantly with the treatment a close (adult) family member received when they needed urgent mental-health care earlier this year. Within 3 days of presentation at the GP, they'd already been offered anti depressants, a program intensive talking therapy treatment four days a week and could be treated either a day patient or as a residential patient -they could choose at a local BUPA insured hospital. We could have gone down that route too if we'd been allowed to - but for DCs the process is very different and painfully slow, and as I said her case was too risky for them.There's a very small number of child appropriate psychiatrists in the local pool and there are so many young people needing desperate help. So adults are well served and children are not. Due to a recent suicide in a young persons private ward, I understand there's greater safeguarding measures in place now. Professionals are wary of the suicidal child and are busily generating oodles of red tape to cover themselves. Of course there clearly are not the same staffing, resources or facilities for young people either. Sadly my DD's the piggy in the middle of all this. She now has a file with pages and pages of paperwork outlining her case many times by various professionals, yet she has had no real practical help so far this past month. There's a terrible gap between a suicidal child presenting themselves and the delayed response of professionals and our DCs are falling into this. DD has, in her own way, begged for assistance out of the very dark place and I could see yesterday she was defeated by the lack of response and dozens of repeated questions going nowhere. We have to somehow keep her going until this appointment in a weeks time and hope they really pull their finger out then. As a family we have to brace ourselves for her continued and desperate wish to self harm end her own life."
TheTruthCouldOut,Fri 01-Jul-16 20:33:01," Weak. We were referred but after an acknowledgment letter saying we'd get an appointment, we heard nothing else. We went private for therapy. This is for a depressed teenager."
Maggiet24,Mon 03-Oct-16 08:05:29,"My son and I have been involved with Merton CAMHS since 2009. I would say as a diagnostic service it was excellent. Structured appointments, diagnosis etc. Disappointingly though when diagnosis is dispensed so are you with little basic information.Trying to reaccess the service for depression, aggressive behaviour, suicidal ideation is another matter entirely - we poor telephone support; lost notes; one clinician disagreeing with another clinician on diagnosis and then fixed views and poor treatment.What strikes me is at the heart should be the child but it is not; a culture of blame, if we cant fix with the basic tool box lets just ignore, poor communication and services that does not even meet industry best practice for therapeutic service i.e BACP. HCPC. This is not an empathic service but one clearly outdated, underfunded and overrun - but it is essential.I have fought hard desperately wanting to get help for my son; the school phoned and emailed, ignored; the GP wrote, contacted Springfield to be told we have to go back through CAMHS and after a sharp/rude letter from CAMHS to the GP, I finally got a call offering an appointment again this Thursday. Disappointingly my request for a different opinion seems to have been thwarted as the clinician previously involved has placed herself in the appointment so I am fully expectin the same opinion, not being listened to and no help. Again I have experienced narrow minded views; research says (with no substance and totally out of date).This thread is very useful but the questions are how is this information going to help. What are the plans for review and improvement. For example what type of supervision of therapists take place along with their own personal therapy - transference/burn out surely are a concern???? Effective practice more up to date and efficient support / in school counselling, DBA, EMDR. Why do other CAMHS services publish the support they offer on websites and are very transparent whereas Merton hide behind an iron curtain? Where is the client/patient/child at the centre of this service?I would love to hear how plans are to review and improve a service that clearly has not been looked at in over a decade but is so important. CAMHS needs bringing into the present and supported!"
BenguinsMummy,Sun 29-Jan-17 20:04:16," Your best option would be getting your DD referred to CAHMS, you can request this through your GP... Depression has several ways of being treated, for example medications, counselling or both, a proper assessment t would determine the best form of treatment for your DD if she is depressed."
lazymum99,Mon 14-May-12 16:53:34,"anxiety is sometimes treated with some anti-depressants. My son was put on them at 18 although he was not depressed but suffered from an anxiety disorder. This combined with CBT was very helpful. I don't know if they use it on teenagers but beta-blockers are sometimes used to reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety/panic attacks. For extreme anxiety which can be completely incapacitating anti-psychotics such as quietapine can be used in small doses. DS1 had these for a short period, they reduced the anxiety but made him like a zombie so he stopped.You should google all of these to set an overview. Only the psychaiatrist can prescribe, not the psychologist."
TataClaire,Tue 08-Jan-13 10:21:08,"I was diagnosed with panic disorder when I was approaching gcse's and was given beta blockers Propranalol and they were great because they stopped my heart from racing and my breathing getting out of control. Unless she's clinically depressed try to stay away from anti depressants as they can cause other issues. Get her to work on proper diaphragm breathing and relaxation techniques and get her to learn the biology behind a panic attack, as once you understand them, you realise they are rather like a wave, they can't last forever and they pass, they're just your fight or flight reaction going haywire. I went from severe panic disorder where I couldnt even leave the house to having a completely normal and successful life. Good luck to her."
mandymumsy,Sun 03-Feb-13 08:05:23,My 15 year old dd is very depressed and sometimes suicidal. She has been bullied for a long time at school. She is having CBT and talking therapy but there is a long waiting to see a psychiatrist and then hopefully receive some medication. She is much worst when at school and feels totally worthless at the moment. Please is anyone else going through this? I wonder whether to give up work. I enjoy my job but she is my priority and I am scared to not be with her when she is really low.
guineapiglet,Sun 03-Feb-13 19:21:04,"Hi mandy - please do not give up or despair, Have been through very similar with my daughter and I am happy to talk to you about it, we are through the worst, but it has taken over two years, and sadly I did have to give up my job in the end, as I felt I just had to be there. Will write more tomorrow if you feel it would help, just off out now, but happy to help and give support . X"
mandymumsy,Tue 12-Mar-13 06:30:38,Really worried about my 14 year old dd. Very depressed and won't often talk to me about it like she had done until recently. Feel like I'm walking on eggshells. She has seen a psychiatrist now but she felt as depression caused by bullying which has left her traumatised medication is not really the answer for her but she is having CBT. gets very angry with me which is not like here at all. We have always been very close and open with each other and able to talk about anything but now she is withdrawn and I found shes looking at internet sites about suicide and wrist cutting.
OhTheRoses,Thu 19-Jan-17 21:47:19,"Yep that all rings bells user. But by the time my DD hit GCSE's she was anxious, depressed and becoming anorexic. School never raised a single concern because she was high performing. Disruptions really an annoyed her.Take it seriously op. At 17 dd ws diagnosed with mild ADHD, ADD variant. It nearly destroyed her. If you are actually being offered help and support then please take it."
InkyPinky66,Fri 06-Jan-17 11:28:46,"Hi, This is long I applogise please bare with me. My son has just turned 14 although he's struggled his whole life with things 'normal' for want of a better word people do without even thinking about it. i.e.; dressing/clothes, hygiene, socialising, school.. too many to mention. But it's safe to say our lives are very hard every single day and always have been. Iv recently had a referral made to cahms from my gp as a very last resort after the school told me they are convinced he's suffering with Asperger syndrome, something I'd never heard of but did some homework and it was like a stranger had wrote an essay on my son, broke my heart that he could have been suffering for so long with no support as no one knew, despite the struggles we've had No one has ever suggested this before. Anyway we had a meeting at the school and they said they would now support him when he struggles and lay off him a bit. Fast forward to this week, first day back at school we drop them off. 3 hours layer I get a txt from my son saying he's cold and can he come home. He didn't go into school and was wandering around on his own in the cold. He said he's given up on that school, he's given up on life and doesn't see the point anymore. I rang the school, explained what had happened, explained how low his mood was so they were aware as his mood changes so often it's unbelievable. I got him through the doors the next day with word from the teacher she would sort something out to get him through the day and that everything would be fine don't worry. Yesterday, he had a group of girls calling him names I won't even say on here cos they're vile.. for 2 classes and through lunch they were on his case. He then got asked by a teacher in the 3rd class to sit by the said girls to which my son refused and went and stood in the corner of the room (sounds odd I know but iv told him to remove himself from situations before they esculate) The teacher then went on to call him pathetic and the girls also threw a few more jabs his way, he was sent out of class and then punched a wall which had resulted in a broken hand,. This is the 2nd broken hand in 6 months in school. Another teacher came out and said she heard the teacher and that it makes her feel uncomfortable when she hears him through the wall and took my son to first aid crying. I don't know what to do.. I'm literally in tears writing this. I feel I should take him out of school for his own safety(he's never hurt anyone else physically) but bullies his younger brother everyday. But my partner disagrees about taking him out. The two girls also pulled my year 7 son after my own her son was sent hom and said the same vile things things to him about his brother too, so he's off today Too as I didn't have it in me to send him in and go through it all again today. The first time he broke his hand a teacher verbally goaded him into losing his rag and iv been told he's no longer teaching at the school but again yesterday another teacher had handled it appallingly and they haven't even had the decency to ring me other than to say to come and collect him. He's miserable, depressed has crippling anxiety and barely leaves the house or his room. He hates life, can't sleep, so can't get up in the morning and it's just an awful cycle we're all stuck in. What do I do: Iv been told it will be a year or more for a referral because of his age. But even with a diagnosis that won't help much surely because I need someone to understand him not just try and cure him. I don't know. I'm stuck. We're stuck. And we've got zero support and iv got my son with his hand in a cast again who can't even drag himself out of bed today. TBH I feel exactly the same. I can't bare seeing him so miserable anymore and me making it worse sending him into an awful situation everyday (school) where he's so uncomfortable he will get himself sent out of class just so he can sit alone in inclusion because to him that's better than being in a class full of people with triggers everywhere that he can't control. Most of This probably make no sense so I apologise. I'm literally at my wits end. Any advice welcome and sorry for the long winded waffle."
TheHoldings,Mon 02-Jan-17 00:05:40,"Thanks Peebles we're not close to him at all mostly when we visit he just stays in his room. Occasionally he has come out to lunch with us but he doesn't want to talk much - he used to engage with my dcs really well but now has no interest. He seems chronically shy and getting more so all the time.I was thinking leaflets would be a good way to get him to think that there is help out there, he needs hope. I worry he can't remember feeling more confident - he was at 14 and thinks this is just the way he is. We were thinking he might agree to see a therapist who did home visits to begin with, someone who didn't need a GP referral. His Mum is coping with daily life, holding down a job etc despite being depressed but she probably doesn't have the energy to seek out a solution, she is just convinced nothing is going right in her life and can't see a way through. But she is starting to try to encourage him to come out of his room and do stuff he enjoys around the home. And would be able to help him work his way through a program of graduated challenges.Limiting wifi doesn't seem to be a good strategy as he is on his phone a lot rather than gaming. I think his parents thought he was displaying typical teenager behaviour for quite a few years but without the need to attend school he has retreated to the safety of his room. So we will try to nudge both his Mum and him in the right direction - we can't talk to him about it, he'd be horrified and mortified but we can help his Mum see a way out and just be a listening ear we know we will need to tread gently."
spendthrift,Sat 11-Feb-12 00:34:55,Look up dabrowski syndrome. It's not uncommon with high performing children. Yes he can be depressed. Pm me if you want for not identical but similar issues and what we did.
RedTurtle,Wed 15-Feb-12 21:38:11,"Actually, I told her everything he's said when he's been angry/upset but I didn't tell he those specific words. I said that he's talked about wanting to die and wanting to kill himself - but only when he's in the middle of ones of his rages. I didn't omit the strangling story deliberately, I was just trying to get everything out. To be honest, she didn't seem shocked or especially interested in that and the way she was nodding made me feel that maybe it wasn't as big a deal as I thought (that may sound strange but it is the feeling I got from her).She seemed more interested in asking what sports DS plays and talking about rugby season. She is an older GP and has a bit of a vacant air about her so I couldn't really tell what her reaction was. I was so relieved that she referred him that I didn't think about adding anything else.Should I have pushed that? When those words come into my head, I tell myself ""he felt that way in that particular moment because he was so frustrated but that doesn't mean he is actually suicidal"". DS is very extreme in many things he says, as in ""this is THE WORST DAY of my life"" when something relatively minor thwarts him. I am hoping that the talk of death is just an expression of that. Do you think I'm doing the wrong thing by downplaying it?"
kebek,Mon 25-Jul-16 11:46:57,"HiMy 12 year old son has aspergers and lately his rages have become so bad and more frequent that he's scaring me and the other children. Generally, he is a happy boy who adores school, can be really lovely and understands about his autism. But recently as he becomes a teen, his rages are getting worse and I don't quite know what to do. This weekend he was so angry at having to help clear the table that he picked up the bread knife from the table and started banging it down over and over again. For a split second I was worried he'd attack me. He also picked up a glass bowl and threatened to throw it at me. I ignored it and left the room, but I was quite scared. He has managed to stop himself on these occasions and I can't say whether he would go that far, I like to think not - but a year ago it wouldn't have entered my mind that he could even threaten me. In addition, his younger siblings are really scared. This has been going on for a while. Usually the flash point is bedtime which can go on for an hour. We try to send him to his room to calm down where he has lots of strategies, but he gets hysterical refuses to go, slams doors, screams loads, throws things. He's a big boy and there's no way I'd try and force him up the stairs. I need help.I don't know whether he's depressed, whether it's autism or whether it's a pre-teen boy, but he can't be happy and I want him to be the happy, sweet boy he can be and for us all to live together happily. Any advice gratefully appreciated."
crackalacking,Mon 12-Dec-16 10:52:58,"Hi i'm new here ....i don't know how to help my daughter who is 15 .her dad and i split up nearly 3 years ago and since then he hasnt put the effort in to see her or my other two sons.he lives in the same town as us but for what ever reasons he wont try to see them.this is the main reason why she struggles so much ,her self esteem is at an all time low ,she is very intelligent as does well at school but cant cope with the pressure of the exams coming up ,she hates the way she looks even though to all who know her she is gorgeous. she is very low and we have been to the child and adolescent mental health team who said she wasn't depressed ,they suggested she have counselling ....she tried it for a few sessions and she didn't feel it helped her at all.they said she was highly anxious and she has regular panic attacks at home and at school. the gp said she cant have anti depressants as she is too young and to be honest i don't want her to take them but she feels that is the only option for her .she talks of not being here she sees nothing to live for and says everyday is an uphill struggle .she has no plans for the future .im so upset and worried about her and dont know what else i can do .we do have a family support worker who sees her once every two weeks at school and she tries to work on her self esteem. it doesn't help that all her friends exclude her from social gatherings because of her panic attacks and all she does all day at school is cry .she is exhausted and so am i ....any advice would be helpful at this point .thanks for reading so far ."

She is a different child now and if you can Home ed I would seriously consider it.Another option you may want to look at is the 14-16 provision to do some GCSEs at college. I am not too sure on how it works but it may be worth a Google!"
annette1230,Sun 27-Nov-16 01:57:40,"* Please share and take a minute to think if this was your child ! It's to late for my daughter but not for others . A GP will and can also give the same drugs or any other they see fit to children as young as 13 14 15 without your consent . It can be signed by anyone in the world *My 16-year-old daughter Britney made an appointment with her local GP without my knowledge or consent. She explained to the GP that she was a self-harmer and was having night terrors and suffering from depression and anxiety, and having suicidal impulses. Britney was 16 years old at the time of the appointment.The GP subsequently prescribed 40mg of Propanol to be taken three times a day and this prescription was duly filled by the local pharmacist with 84 tablets issued – a month’s supply at once.At no stage was I aware of the consultation with the GP or that Britney had been prescribed this medication or the quantity of medication prescribed, because the law currently allows GPs to prescribe young persons under-18 medication without the knowledge or consent of the parents or guardians.Sixteen days later, Britney overdosed on Propanol. The police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances. This was the first I know of my daughter’s prescription and consultation with her GP, despite the fact she express to her GP that she had mental health concerns. I was not made aware of this until after my daughter’s death.I believe that the type of medication and care required specifically related to mental health issues requires a particular approach when diagnosing and treating these kinds of conditions in younger people.The strength and effect of some mental health medications make it important that parents and guardians are fully involved and aware of the circumstances, allowing them to support treatment and ensure that pathways of care are most appropriate for their children.The quantity and strength of medications prescribed to Britney represented a danger to herself, and I believe that my daughter may still be with us if I had been privy to the information that was vital to her care and health issues.There are undoubtedly cases where young people with mental health issues require prescription medication, in addition to other forms of care. However this should only be done in the case of under-18s with the involvement, knowledge and consent of the parents or guardians.I ask the Petitions Committee to investigate this issue fully to try and ensure no more parents have to go through what I have gone through in recent months and are still going threw . http://www.parliament.scot/GettingInvolved/Petitions/PE01627"
Pollyanna9,Wed 23-Nov-16 19:55:46,"Hi allI'm not looking to jump on any bandwagon 'hoping' that this is the case at all (far from it) however, can I explain some stuff about my son and see what you think? I'm trying to determine in my own mind if he's just withdrawn and depressed or just being a bugger, or if it's something more.I'll start with something recent. DS is 17. He only really enjoys playing Xbox and does no other social activities, never goes to friends houses or vice versa. The only time I hear animated speaking is when he's talking thru his Xbox gaming with his mates. So that could just be normal or it could be one of the traits of preferring own company.He is a July baby so already quite behind his peers. Recently I've required him (because he should be able to do it at this age) to catch the train to go meet his dad for contact. Because I work F/T and because if I got stuck in traffic he could miss his train I said to him whilst it's light (this was a couple of months ago) take the bus a few times then if ever it gets past 5.20pm you'll be able to say right I'd better get the bus mum's not going to be back in time. I even created a map so he'd know exactly the route and where to get off. Well come the first night I wanted him to do this I made sure that I didn't get home in time because I just had a feeling there were going to be problems. Lo and behold when I arrived home a good 40 mins after his 2nd train would already have departed, there he is, 'hiding' in the bathroom with me conversing through the door - why didn't you take the bus? I didn't want to. Why? Just didn't want to. When he finally came out I had a long conversation - he just was not having it. And not in a babying way but I could see that there was something about it that perturbed him (so not being a snowflake but something else as I think if I'd gone on about it he would actually have cried). Cut to the last few Mondays and he's been cutting college (not telling me of course) and weirdly this coincides with classes that start 1pm and don't finish until 4.30pm - and they have to get to that campus by bus!! I actually think that's why he's cutting class. Does that ring bells with anyone? Is he just being a berk or could it genuinely be distressing him? He puts f all effort into college and I'm seeing his tutor next Thursday to discuss it all because frankly if he's going to piss about and not put the effort in he'd be better flipping burgers at McDonalds than going to college to do courses that he clearly can't be bothered to put the effort in with. This is an ongoing pattern since GCSE years - not working hard, not revising hard, not even trying his best - just scraping by with results that are several grades lower than he's very much capable of achieving. So a lot of lying and not engaging and forget communicating with his teachers - about anything. If he finds a situation he can't deal with he just goes head in the sand/avoid.[Much like his dad]Cutting back to when he was a baby. We were really really close. When my DD came along I had a shock moment. I was taking her upstairs for a nap and she snaked her arm round the back of my neck - DS had NEVER done anything like that and it wasn't until she did it that I realised he never had! There was love aplenty but he's really really undemonstrative. I actually don't really try and hug him now - he doesn't respond. His dad hugs him and he kinda half responds but he's very stiff throughout.He's always been a singular child - he was incredibly sensitive to loud noises and fairly sensitive. Now he's deadpan most of the time, if I didn't speak to him he'd leave and re-enter the house without saying goodbye, he has no social life other than through Xbox, he won't do ANYTHING else at all, when he talks to me he's often monotone and only animated of voice when he's on Xbox. I would say it's all me but his dad mentioned that he's often highly uncommunicative with him too. To be honest I often feel like he hates me but that could just be me. I just have so little to do with him - he's literally in his bedroom apart from when he comes down to eat and that's about all I see him. I offer to watch a film with him and so on but he's never interested.Whilst he avoids socialising day to day if he's with family he's ok - he played guitar for us all last Boxing Day at my brothers. He doesn't do anything like avoiding eye contact or anything like that.But it's this bus thing - I just cannot decide what that's all about because to be a snowflake who doesn't feel he should have to set foot on a bus is one thing, having some kind of bus phobia is another thing altogether!Can any suggest any good checklists or anything or what should I be asking his tutor at college next Thursday?Any help or advice gratefully received and I know this is in mental health so I'm not sure if this is the right spot as I know it's a genetically inherited neurological condition but I wasn't sure where else to put it."
RegentsParkWolf,Wed 09-Nov-16 20:47:21," I wouldn't make a big deal about the anniversary - I think anniversaries can be really unhelpful. Don't bring it up unless he does. Also, a year isn't long. It's been two and a half years since my DD took an overdose and looking back, although she self harmed after that, she didn't attempt suicide again but it was constantly on my mind for two years. To begin with I'd wake every morning wondering if she was alive. Then gradually it got a bit better but every time she was late home, every time she was in a bad mood, I'd worried myself sick. I've finally begun to relax in the last six months but even now, if I come home and she's not here when I was expecting her to be in I can feel dreadful. I think maybe I'll never be able to completely relax again which is crazy because she's really not at all suicidal any more and hasn't been for a very long time. It's just something I have to accept and, as I say, it's been much better in the last six months. If you're sure (as sure as you can be) that he's doing OK and that your fear isn't a sixth sense telling you something's wrong then just keep reminding yourself that it's normal to be worried but try not to let him see it."
yummymumsie,Mon 14-Nov-11 21:23:32,I can't speak highly enough of Camhs. My son was in a terrible state with depression and suicidal feelings (and awful anxiety). His Camhs worker knew exactly how to help him and he is now a happy normal ten year old equipped with the tools to help him deal with the problems life throws in our path.In our case the camhs worker came and spoke to us first and then arranged an appointment to see our son. She usually saw him at home but sometimes at school and everything was done in a way that he was comfortable. Our son became very fond of his Camhs worker and was very comfortable with her.Good luck and I really hope your child benefits as much as ours has
strawberrymivvi,Thu 05-Jan-12 13:19:37,"I think it depends on your local authority. I heartened to hear some positive experience of CAMHS. Our experience was crap in the extreme. Ds was badly bullied and ended up self harming and suicidal. After one appointment, they said he was fine - it was the wrong kind of self harm and he didn't really mean he wanted to die. A year later we were still really struggling to cope, got referred again and this time saw a nurse who told us the problem was we were enabling the behaviour - ""Children only kick holes in walls and hurt themselves if you let them"" was her best statement and she was a specialist children's mental health nurse. I was so incandescent I couldn't speak. Anything I said would been seen as proof of our bad parenting. I walked out of the building and stuck my finger up at it. I've since spoken to our school nurse who wasn't surprised. She said they had less than zero funding and they (the school nurses) can't even get CAMHS to give help to families where children attack their parents. This was 3 years ago now, Ds is getting there, he rarely harms himself but we've had to do a lot of the work ourselves, a couple of supportive and understanding teachers have been our lifeline at times which is not how it should be. I can honestly say his year 5 teacher saved our family. I sincerely hope you get some help from CAMHS."
alibobins,Sat 07-Jan-12 08:16:47,Hi Dd11 was referred to CAHMS around 6 months ago the initial appointment came through quite quick but think that was based on the fact dd's behaviour had become quite threatening and was having suicidal thoughts  We were then seen at home as a family then it took around 3 months for dd to get the 1-1 support they wanted her to have she now sees a lovely worker on a weekly bases however it has not been a magical cure and sometimes after the appointment dd comes back in a really bad mood as she just can't seem to understand the concept of all the issues discussed.She has also been to see a pead who has suggested some form of Asd so we are just playing a waiting game.Dd has a very complicated case she has also got medical condition requiring aggressive treatment in hospital including very high doses of IV steroids  these make her very difficult to control x x
amberjane,Mon 16-Jan-12 13:30:31,"hi again, well we have been given our initial appointment for 14th Feb but realise still to be officially accepted and then long waiting list? Really scared bout this app as dd8 so low what if they offer no help? She has zero friends and is so depressed school can do no more. She is down to see a consultant so hope he can help guide us? Hope everyone doing ok?????"
lbab1702,Wed 28-Sep-16 13:51:13,"Hi thereYour poor DD. I'd take her to the doctor now, rather than leaving it. It may be nothing, or general teenage downs /hormonal etc. On the other hand it could be the start of something more serious. My DD, now 16, was similar at 14 and I did nothing, other than talk to the school and she had a few sessions with a school counsellor. Fast forward to now, and she's under Cahms, being treated for an eating disorder and depression. She's currently very suicidal and has just been prescribed anti-depressants. She's gone from anorexia to binge eating and is a very unhappy girl. I wish I'd done something sooner. I didn't realise how much she was bottling things up, until the anorexia started. I'm sure it's all connected to her anxiety and withdrawl at 14. Definitely worth a visit to GP now, just in case."
Saund123,Mon 17-Oct-16 13:59:54,"Hi there , I'm going through the same with my daughter who has just turned 15 . She struggles with anxiety and I think she may be a little depressed at times . I'm struggling to get her to school the last 2 weeks and she had a bad year 9 , till the summer term , after she had had sessions of CBT with a psychologist, that seemed to help . She started year 10 really well , but a couple of weeks ago , her anxiety came back and she can't get herself up out of bed in the morning , even tho she's saying she is fine and she's getting up , it's just her saying that as she's trying her best to move , she then gets frustrated and angry cos she feels like she's letting me down and school down . When she's at school she's fine , where as when it first started she used to have panic attacks and ring me to fetch her . She has a fab group of friends and gets on well with teachers , so we don't know what her fear of school is . The attendance office are being a bit funny , but her year head is trying to keep them at bay . We have a meeting at school in morning and my daughter knows she will have to accept some help from them as camhs will take ages to get appt . I feel crap as a mom as I can't make her anxiety go away , she is a usual stubborn teenager too , when her anxiety is not rife , she is great she goes out with mates and does athletics. I've just come on here for some advice and to know we are not the only ones going through it . I'm at the end of my tether ATM as every morning I'm on egg shells wondering if she's going to get up . She gets up eventually and she's been doing school work all morning . Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
cheeesecheesecheese,Sun 11-Sep-16 15:24:04,"Hi there, my daughter is a similar age and has got into this anime stuff via one of her friends and I really don't like it. Some of that stuff, the drawings and song videos, seem to focus on depressive thoughts and make references to self harm and suicide. My daughter and her friend have had a lot of difficult family shit to deal with (different issues for each family) in the last year and whilst I encourage the sharing of difficult feelings as being as valid as positive feelings I really don't like this stuff. I think early adolescence can be a very tough time for them emotionally, hormones, new feelings etc. However, in my view, some particular girls seem to take this 'depressed teenager' identity to heart. What I mean is that whilst acknowledging that they are experiencing new and difficult emotions there can be a tendency to over dramatise this stuff. However some young people do experience genuine mental distress and it's tough to know which it is.I don't know that I can give you any helpful advice but I do understand your concerns and I don't think you are alone.The only thing I can suggest is trying to talk with her and if she is experiencing negative and depressing thoughts are they a genuine cause for concern or is it normal teenage angst? Hopefully another poster will come along with something more helpful."
Tiffanytwisted,Sun 15-May-16 20:57:33,"Just that really. Can I just rant a bit ? DS is 11, needs everything explaining to him, very quick to correct me if I muddle my words or make a mistake and can't be trusted to do most things without extra help. DD is a very difficult teenager, under CAMHS, school refusal, meltdowns, obsessions that take over her life, doesn't understand that I need some space occasionally and will follow me around talking constantly.They both have aspergers and create mess and chaos and problems. I do love them very much but I am struggling to stay on top of things. I work part time but am losing work because of the kids appointments and needs and clients see me as unreliable now. DH is depressed and has been for about ten years, tried different therapies and medications but comes off them as soon as he feels better and lapses again. He is lovely but very remote and needs all his energy to cope with his demanding job and admits there's nothing left for me as the kids need so much. I have been writing this post in my head all day and now I'm writing it on here they keep bursting in wanting me to do things and find things and why isn't this clean, where is my bag, can you do this for us now....I feel as if I am trying to swim in the middle of the sea and going under. I so want some peace and time alone but I can't go anywhere as school phone most days because of problems with the kids. I know I am very lucky compared to some as I have friends (who can't really help but sympathise) but I feel like I'm always whinging to them. Family are very needy and want to visit but then complain that the kids don't behave or the house isn't tidy enough. Everyone sees me as some kind of superwoman I think. But if I'm not then we all stop swimming. Thanks for reading, tell me how you cope with this sort of life?"
Bex134,Thu 09-Jun-16 19:54:43,"16-18 yrs is a tricky age group, 16 and above are able to consent to their own treatment but under 18s still fit with child protection. So say if your child was experiencing suicidal ideation it would be for parents to be involved in support plan in keeping them safe. You are always able to contact camhs to speak to the allocated worker and tell them your feedback, they may be limited with what they can say back but important for you to feel involved.. This does not break confidentiality. Sometimes an agreement between DD and camhs with what will be shared can help your child feel more confident in sharing. Risk concerns have to be shared. I work for camhs and always feel uncomfortable when a parent is not involved in some way. If DD is happy for you to transport to appointments but wait in waiting room that may help in terms of being visible. Over time your DD may be happy for you to join sessions."

He spends a lot of time lying in bed being more or less catatonic. He has complained of suicidal thoughts again. I don't know about him, I've had 2.5 years of this and I have moments like that myself. There are times you just feel useless. (In our case this is despite excellent CAMHS care)."

Mishaps,Tue 10-May-16 16:22:44,"I am sorry that your teenagers are having these problems. SSRIs (which includes sertraline and fluoxetine) are known to have the potential to increase suicidal thoughts, especially in younger patients. They do need very close monitoring - and teenagers do not like that. Sadly CAMHs are very patchy around the country and very poorly staffed.What a dreadful worry and stress this must be for you all."

seriouslyworried,Thu 19-May-16 19:40:11,"Hi Martha, sorry to hear about your DD. At the height of my daughters anxiety and depression she was hearing voices a lot and it was a really tough time. She kept it quiet for sometime but they got to the point where she could no longer live with them. They were very negative and would tell her to do awful things. She has been under tier 3 Camhs for over a year now and her counsellor reassured me that she did not feel it was schizophrenia but rather my daughters own negative perception of herself. The psychiatrist decided to try fluoxetine which, over 6months, enhanced everything leading to self harm, suicidal thoughts, two trips to A&E with attempted overdoses and the worse period of our lives! Ditching the fluoxetine has seemed to bring her back to a better place than she has been in for a long time. I know that whole period terrified her as she had no control over her feelings and emotions. She is now very aware of her triggers and takes melatonin which is a god send as it sends her off to sleep within 30 mins of taking it. We are by no means out of the woods and the affect the last year has taken on her school work is irreparable! Blimppy you are right...it is just like a bereavement, not just for the future that could have been, but for the daughter I had for so many years...I miss her! There are glimpses of her old self, but we are always walking on eggshells and it only takes the slightest thing for the walls to start crumbling. Camhs have been amazing and the bond that DD has with her counsellor is great. She has been there for her and been supportive with getting DD back into a better school routine, even if it has meant dropping some subjects. I wish you the best for you and your DD and I hope Camhs give you both the right support. I apologise if this all sounds doom and gloom but we are definitely in a better place than we were. Were it not for music I don't know where we would be. DD has been able to let me know what she has been going through and feeling by playing certain songs. I said it before but Twenty one pilots have been our saving grace. They have a song called Addict with a pen, and the first time I heard it I cried. It was like a light came on and I could see what DD had been going through...a beautifully honest song that could have been written by anyone with a mental illness to their parent."

The referral letter goes on to say that for many families this appointment is enough to get the family back on track and they don't need any follow on treatment!! That makes me want to cry. Dd needs ongoing psychiatric support/therapy.Dd is distressed and agitated. She's aggressive and attacked me quite severely last night. Today she had a knife in her hand and said she wanted to hurt me.Dd is very articulate and said today that her brain feels mixed up. All the pathways are wrong and she wanted to go to hospital.  We've tried that and as she's not actively suicidal they can't offer her any support.I think the withdrawal from the anti psychotic might explain why she's so agitated. I feel as though everyone encouraged me to try meds. The side effects were horrific and now she's having to withdraw. I'm between a rock and a hard place. Horrific anti psychotics versus unmedicated violence.I'm lost and so alone it's horrendous."

thesunwillout,Thu 16-Jun-16 09:26:25,"thankyou blimppy, i t was nice to get out, how are you doing? Love cats, they are so much fun.Well we had a disastrous atitude shift from dd's ' doc yesterday who clumsily said she doesn't have depression anymore.he did apologise for the way he said this (exactly as above)but wasn't keen to up her dose at all, but i insisted it had been helping a tiny bit. I got so upset, dd was in tears. This doc said to me 4 weeks ago that her suicidal thoughts were more likely to be 'the depression' rather than a side effect of the AD's.He is leaving, and will hand her over to someone else. I have no idea what dd said in our session that gave him evidence for that judgement, but he was banging on about clinical eveidence, overall impression of her response (anxiety improvement esp). She said she feels no better mood/sad depressed wise. How this equated to not being depressed anymore is beyond me.I told him that i could not believe he would say such a sweeping statement.He actually said, 'you're not going to like this but...'For now she can up the dose, but wont see anyone to monitor it for 2-3 months. It has also been mentioned that cbt isn't working, (therefore yo'd think it WAS depression) and that she might need to have further different therapy.It's all very conflicting, and basically shit. Her place at her special unit won't be available if Camhs stop seeing her, which hasn't been mentioned but i can't help feeling that they are cutting down on help, and only able to deal with those who are taking overdoses or self harming very regularly.Given that these children have not been helped till now, then others kids will end up as bad."
blimppy,Thu 16-Jun-16 19:10:58,"Hi thesun. That sounds very odd and frustrating for you and it seems really strange he would declare her no longer depressed, and yet agree to up the dose. How is she/you tonight? Interesting what you say about CBT not working. I'm not convinced yet that it can actually lift mood and help with depression, although I can see it can provide tools to help someone cope. I hope raising the dose of meds helps her, but it's completely wrong in my opinion that they are doing that without proper supervision.My DD is still really low - hiding it most of the time, but sometimes not. She has just got really upset over tea as her sister is talking excitedly about a school trip she is going on and what she and her friends are going to do. DD missed out on a school trip earlier this year because of her illness. She has now left college and this week started work in an apprenticeship placement. Unfortunately, it seems all her college friends have dropped her now she has left. I expected some would, but not all. She's so upset, and it is hard to see how she makes new friends without a college/school environment. I don't know what to suggest and it's breaking my heart. She's always had problems with friends and it just makes her feel so worthless."
ealady,Fri 01-Jul-16 13:15:39,"Hi Blimmpy, thank you so much for the moral support. A virtual listening ear sounds great. Middle DD's school have known she has been unsettled and emotional since she started, and I've let them know about her bipolar diagnosis, but honestly they don't seem to know how to handle her. Her head of house wrote her off as a total pain in the arse very early on (I don't think mental health is his speciality!). They've sent her home a few times when she's become unstable, but also made me feel bad if I keep her off. She gets exhausted when she has had a major episode as she has this week. With regards to my youngest, it's so hard to give her 1:1 time because I can never be more than 10 minutes away from her sister. I feel so sorry for her, and I feel so trapped. We've built her a den in the garden so she has somewhere quiet to go and relax when it all gets too much, and we make sure she sees her friends a lot. She also has the transition to high school in September so we will make sure the school counsellor knows the issues. Them both being at the same school could cause more problems. Middle DD is getting excellent help, but she just doesn't seem to want it. CAMHS were hopeless (waited 6 months then were offered art therapy) so fortunately we were insured, but soon the cover will run out and we will have to self fund which will be tough. I'm lucky in that I have an amazing support network of friends, but I haven't had professional help. I'm not sure how I'd even get to an appointment either! Chocolate and wine are seeing me through at the moment  Thank you for listening xx"
inneedofchocolate,Sat 02-Jul-16 19:04:35," How old is your dd? Gender dysphoria can often lead to self-harming and suicidal ideation. Have you looked up Mermaids? It's a charity set up to support children and their families regarding gender issues. There is also an organisation called the Proud Trust, not sure if it's national."
plantlady,Thu 11-Feb-16 11:22:12,"DS is 16 and said he thought he was depressed even before our appointments with CAMHS for severe anxiety and Aspergers. Camhs weren't great and the talking therapy didn't work so we left it for a few weeks to see if anything improved. During that time (over Xmas hols) DS had a couple of mini meltdowns with conversations that were definitely on the worrying side. I made notes at the time and put them in an e-mail prior to the review meeting. Next thing I know we're being referred upwards for depression assessment and DS is now on AD's and having talking therapy. have found the e-mail approach useful as DS opens up better to us. However he's now opening up more to his councillor as he gets to know her.So would recommend trying the prior communication route, DS asks me to be in with him which helps him and he knows that I know what the professional knows. Now all I need to do is work out how to support him and how to get him to try and work for A levels, adopt more healthy life style, take even a little bit of exercise.........If Camhs aren't helpful are you able to go private?"
Mountainwoman37,Thu 05-May-16 17:23:56, Sorry to hear this. I don't have direct experience of this with a seven year old but have experience of dealing with a severely depressed teenager who self harmed/ had suicidal thoughts. She was referred to Camhs and after much wasted time with an ineffective therapist we are getting the right help with a psychiatrist and a psychologist. We got this only by pushing our concerns for her safety/ mental well being by phoning / emailing until we got an appointment with a consultant who realised how unwell she was. I would suggest you phone Camhs and state clearly your concerns about your son- keep phoning/ emailing until you get an appointment. I know Camhs varies considerably re waiting times - be persistent. Your son sounds very distressed and needs help to keep him safe now and address his needs. Young Minds is a good website for info on mental health. Look after yourself.
ToastByTheCoast,Sun 15-May-16 05:27:03,"So sorry if this is wrong place to post, just need some advice on best thing to do/whether what I have done tonight makes things worse.I had a 3am call today from by DS who is a student. The call was about someone else in university halls. The other boy often seems depressed (totally lay judgement here, I don't know if diagnosed or being treated).Tonight the other boy has been posting very worrying messages and photos on.social media. Other students in the group were worried, but it sounds as if this is not the first time he has made these comments. They checked on him when home and found him in bed, apparently asleep but couldn't wake him. They seemed pretty sure he just seemed asleep though, not unconscious. But there was something lying on floor which indicated he had been intending really serious, possibly deadly, self-harm. Other students removed this and all went to bed.My son rang me at 3 am to tell me what had happened, he said he wasn't sure why he called me, I think just for reassurance. I suggested checking on the other student again and going to the uni welfare service in the morning but it is the weekend and no welfare contacts seem available until Monday morning (have googled). The halls are run by a private company rather than the actual uni, so nothing on site. Son (none too sober himself), then rang off to go to sleep.I have been lying awake worrying for this boy. I do admit my worries are stronger because I know someone who lost her lovely son in similar circumstances. This might make me over-react but then I would rather this than something awful happen.It didn't seem right to call an ambulance or the police; my son said there was no evidence of tablets/overdose etc in the room. Eventually, I found an emergency number for the halls online, rang it and spoke to night security. They are going to patrol and ask other students if he is ok, then refer to day security in the morning. I'm worried that this might not be handled very tactfully and will further upset the boy in the morning. My son will realise it is me who has told halls, but I am not concerned about that, more the impact on the boy and whether I have been heavy handed here and should have left things until proper (trained) support was available on Monday.Or should I have done more? Have I over-reacted or under-reacted? Should I leave things now or still call Student Welfare on Monday? Would really appreciate some perspective or advice here. Thanks."

AnxiousMunchkin,Wed 01-Mar-17 21:29:24,"I didn't know that about not being allowed to post about self harm or suicidal thoughts in any detail. I know that at Samaritans they say that you can't convince someone to self harm or take steps to end their life just by talking about it. I think if MNHQ are going to delete threads like that they need to do it very sensitively with an appropriate deletion message clearly explaining why, where the acceptable boundaries are and offering/signposting sources of ongoing support, so people in distress are not left abruptly cut off from support like you were the other day, sadandanxious. Sounds like your counselling session was tough today. Hope you're having a quiet and restful evening to recuperate. I have been emailing a little with OCD Action support and they sent an email back yesterday asking how I was and I replied with a whole flood of emotion. I feel awful at the moment. Have been getting horrendous headaches at the end of the working day. This evening cancelled the plans I had and have just come straight home to hide under a blanket on the sofa, don't have the motivation to eat properly. Feel sick and restless and like my heart is racing. OCD Action can only really offer support about the OCD stuff though (understandably) so after sending my missive to them yesterday, today I have bitten the bullet and sent an enquiry to a counsellor/psychotherapist I had looked up who was reasonably affordable and local but also offers therapy via email which really appeals. The revelation about the influence of my mother's behaviour has really left me a little shell shocked. I've been reading about narcissitic/toxic parents and the 'out of the fog' website (fear, obligation, guilt) and it all fits. It's scary. Has anyone/does anyone have general counselling/therapy alongside formal CBT? Is that ok? I just have such little faith that the CBT will help much with the whole picture. I think I'm going to take a Sominex in a bit and try and get a good nights sleep. It'll be a start."
GinAndSonic,Sat 18-Feb-17 21:35:08,"I beleive you. Im so sorry you didn't get the outcome you wanted and that things are so tough for you right now. I never reported my rapes, but I did have rape counselling and it was so helpful. I was referred to them by a domestic violence worker, could one of the professionals you are involved with do the referal rather than you having to self refer? It probably won't speed it up but it takes the pressure off of you needing to make the call. My local rape crisis centre has helpline evenings where you can call to just talk or you can email a dedicated address to just talk, it's not counselling but it's a volunteer listening service. Alternatively maybe samaritans? They have an email service too that I used when supporting a suicidal friend. "
isupposeitsverynice,Mon 20-Feb-17 16:17:47,"Ahh mate. Here, I'll tell you what's wrong with you - some fucking prick violated and traumatised you to a point where you can't have a nice walk up the road without freaking out. It's all on him. None of this is your fault. Just take it slow and steady - you can get through this and you will get through and you'll be even stronger and more amazing than you already are (true story, don't argue, you are great, I know things, me )I wonder about meds and that. I mean obviously for some people they clearly work and that's ace, but for people like you and me I wonder if they really do much? Cuz like, are we depressed as such? Or are we just completely justifiably fucked off and angry because of what's been done to us? Not the same is it, or maybe it is, I dunno. If they help you sleep you're getting some value out of them so that's something? By the way your bathroom plans sound ace, I love the sound of the colour scheme, very cheering. Have you got anything in mind for a treat with your saved up money? I er, accidentally bought some more notebooks while I was out for my (faintly useless) workshop. They've got this gorgeous floral pattern. I am drowning in notebooks tbh. Oh and some cinnamon incense, it smells just like that dentyne chewing gum they used to sell."
manateeandcake,Fri 03-Mar-17 12:59:33,"I have a very good friend who I've know for years and I've been concerned for a while about her mood swings. She seems to cycle very rapidly from very low to very ""up"" in a short space of time, and I think this is getting more pronounced. What I'm wondering is whether I should try to talk to her about it.She's had a tough few years and I have been there for her as much as possible through the difficult times. In many ways she appears to be in a better place now, but I was concerned by some exchanges I had with her recently; there was a day or two when she was clearly depressed, then literally the next day it was ""everything's fine"" (this is common) and more than that -- she was on a high, talking quite fast, taking on a lot of new things, using words and phrases that didn't sound like her. When she's up, she is prone to spending a lot and fairly impulsive behaviour but nothing that would seem very excessive in most situations. I don't have reason to believe she is a danger to herself or others.She does not have a history of MH issues apart from one episode of mild depression. There is a family history of MH problems and substance abuse. To my mind, these unstable moods started after the birth of her DC several years ago, though there are also periods when she seems 100% well. I'm concerned about her but I also don't want to say anything that will make her feel criticised or condescended to. Some of my work is in the MH field which makes it delicate as I don't want her to feel that I am diagnosing her (which I'm not qualified to do in any case) or treating her as a client rather than the friend she is. I'd be grateful for any advice on how best to support her."
TerrorTwilight,Thu 02-Mar-17 14:09:53,"I feel like this is going to look worse than it feels when written down.I'm having some MH difficulties and have had to take more time off work today, after only recently returning after a month absence. After my very supportive and nice boss put me in a taxi home yesterday, following quite a lot of crying in her office (I'm a bloke, and for whatever reason I'm not much of a cryer, so this was significant), I got home. I'd assure my boss there was no scope for me to hurt myself, that I don't have those kinds of thoughts, which is true. I don't want to die. I don't want to hurt myself. I sometimes wish I could painlessly evaporate or cease to exist, but I don't want to do it to myself. At least, I don't think I do. Cos when I got home, I went to the kitchen. I held a small paring knife against my wrist for a few seconds just to sort of imagine what it would take to do that to myself. I didn't press down or use it. Just pressed the edge very gently against my skin. I don't know why.Then I snapped out of it, shuddered (I hate sharp blades and always wig out at slicing injuries), put the knife back and went over to the window and said ""no"" very vehemently to myself a few times. Then today I took myself off for a walk. Went to the next town over to go to the cinema, trying to keep myself busy. A fast train came through the station and made me jump. Then on my way home (I got an Uber so I'd be back in plenty of time to pick up DD2 from school), I caught myself imagining lying down on the track and waiting for that fast train, how painless it would be, but then dismissed it because of all the distress it would cause. I know, I know, that sounds really bad. But the thing is, I was just IMAGINING it. I didn't feel like I WANTED to do it. In fact I recoiled from both scenarios. It felt v. abstract, just like an odd sort of daydream - like winning the lottery or something. No sense of it being grounded in reality or genuine expectation.I don't think I'm suicidal, but I'm in two minds whether to mention this to the doctor or my therapist because I don't want people to flip out and think I'm about to off myself, when it really doesn't feel like that.I'm completely grounded in needing to be there for my DDs. I am rational enough to know that they need me and that I would ruin their lives if I were to do anything to myself, and their lives are infinitely more important to me than my own. I don't actually feel ""depressed"" right now. The citalopram is taking the edge off my despair. I'm more anxious and trapped than anything else.But am I suicidal? I'm almost scared to put a label on it because I feel like that legitimises the thought processes..."
Iris65,Thu 02-Mar-17 15:48:23,When I am depressed I have those thoughts. In the absence of other symptoms when I start noticing things that I could hurt or kill myself with then I know that I need to look after myself.The fact that you don't want to kill yourself but just want to not exist is familiar to me too. I used to think that it wasn't 'a big deal' but it actually indicates a serious and dangerous level of depression and you are right to be worried. Make sure you get some help 
NolongerAnxiousCarer,Thu 02-Mar-17 22:32:54,"Hi Terror,So sorry to hear that things are so tough. It does sound like you are still quite poorly at the moment and maybe you need to allow yourself a bit more time off sick to recover. If I remember you were only off a few weeks.I can completely relate to the feeling of not wanting to live any more, but not actively wanting to kill myself. I was in that dark place 15 years ago when I was at uni. It was as I started to feel better with ADs and actually some motivation that I became suicidal. Its definately worth mentioning how you are feeling to your Dr. Its really scary when these thoughts come into your head isn't it.I can completely relate to what you describe about not being able to do the 'brain work' I'm still in that stage though I am recovering. I'm recovering from PTSD and as part of that I had anxiety, poor concentration and memory. I also had urges to self harm (not suicide) that were so strong and constant, that I found myself unable to think about anything else even at work, even though I could auto pilot the basics of the job. On the day I went off sick I couldn't remember how to use a computer system I've used for years. Later that day I got stuck in my kitchen because I couldn't work out how to get out. Getting better from that point has been a long process. I had started ADs a couple of months before and was already seeing a councellor and CPN. I had 12 weeks off work and spent that time looking after myself and allowing myself to heal. I went to the gym most days, rested, went for walks and days out by myself following my interests. I then started a phased return to work starting off with just 11/2 hours twice a week and have built it up slowly over the last 8 weeks. I'm now working 1/2 days all week and gradually taking on more duties, but still not back fully in my normal role. What I'm trying to say is give yourself permission to have time off to get better, it was only when I took the pressure off myself that I started to feel better.MH still has a lot of stigma arround it, the important thing to remember is that it is an illness. Would you feel humiliated if you were off with a broken leg? It is getting better gradually and I know that DH has found that when he has talked about his MH problems, so many male collegues and aquaintances have said 'me too'. Infact when he was having a low patch recently he ended up having a long chat about it in the pub with one of the lads who had suffered depression too. Depression can affect anyone. Something that might be worth checking out is Andy's Man Club on facebook.And keep talking on here, these dark times will pass with time."
SoMuchPain,Mon 27-Feb-17 18:59:51,Sea breeze thanks for your reply. I feel like I'm at the end of my tether and really resent my husband. I don't feel this time is precious in fact I'm starting to resent my own children and sometimes wonder why I bothered. They are so needy. We struggle financially some months. I have limited financial control getting an allowance every month for the children. If DH has any money left over he gives me it. That frustrates me as I would just rather know what we can and can't spend. He is looking to resolve this by setting up a joint account. When my MiL and SIL see me they're not very nice really. I have little in common with them. My toddler is such a wilful and defiant child. I am afraid she is turning into a screen addict because she watches television when I can't be bothered doing anything with her. Today she had a class and I didn't go because I couldn't be bothered and I've not left the house all day except for the school run. They have tonnes of toys but always want the television and I can't be bothered playing with them. I think I'm depressed. I am so so fed up. I feel stupid. I too had difficult pregnancies and children in special care. It was a nightmare co-ordinating childcare for my time in hospital. I too was ill and ended back in theatre after my sections. I just feel very alone and I don't care about anyone anymore
eyespydreams,Mon 27-Feb-17 19:19:23," The feeling guilty because on the outside it seems you have everything, but inside you're miserable, the wanting to disappear, the wondering if people would be better off without you - all exactly things I felt when depressed. They all disappeared when I had treatment. Everyone was very kind to me and I got better quite quickly and had therapy etc (but it was the antidepressants that helped first, I will remember the day that I woke up and DIDN'T want to disappear for the rest of my life, it ws so nice! I just was like, ooh, what a nice day, the birds are singing, think I'll go and get a coffee WOOOOOOO! It was really the little things.)"
bibbitybobbityyhat,Mon 27-Feb-17 19:27:47,"Your marriage sounds pretty miserable, it's no wonder you are depressed. If you didn't have to spend so much time alone with your children you wouldn't find it so hard, I promise!You simply need to start by being honest with your husband about all this. And take it from there."
alaia5,Mon 27-Feb-17 19:34:06,"OP - I'm no doctor, but it sounds very much as if you have PND. Please get help tomorrow. It's not just something you can snap out of, it's a chemical change in your brain.Many many women experience what you are now. The medication takes about a month to kick in properly, but it works.It sounds like you live in a quite isolated area? Try and get out every day if you can, but I know it's hard when you feel despairing.You can come through this but you need medical help. "
kealey1977,Mon 27-Feb-17 19:39:50," I agree with eyespy, you do sound very depressed and I would recommend that you make a gp appointment asap. I am in a similar situation and had 3 children within 3 yrs and live 160 miles away from my family and friends. I was diagnosed with post natal depression and went on anti depressants for 12 months and had counselling. I feel much better now but the isolation still gets to me so I always take the kids back home to see family as often as i can. You really should speak to your husband and let him know how you are feeling and if he has any empathy he will have to change his working hour to support you while you deal with the way you are feeling. I wish you all the best and hope you are feeling more positive about life soon."
SoMuchPain,Mon 27-Feb-17 19:51:21,"Thanks everyone. It is difficult to identify in yourself you are depressed. I am in a fairly isolating area. But there is still opportunity for me to get out. As I used to a lot. What is concerning me is that I don't actually want to do anything. I've started job hunting thinking that is my way out but I wonder how will I cope. I'm not myself. I've gone very quiet. Withdrawn is the best way to describe it. I told my DH via WhatsApp today that I'm feeling down. I hope we can speak this evening. People talk of depression a lot in my family it is common. However people say it's best not to go on antidepressants. That it turns you into a zombie. It is best to resolve matters by counselling. GP appointments are difficult to obtain especially with a good GP. I will call my GP. I'll see if I can book something in as soon as possible. I will also speak to my DH about any counselling available via his work health scheme. If I worked then we wouldn't struggle so much. However I don't feel I have a good hold on finances because not having a joint account. My husband isn't frivolous. We have a biggish mortgage and a large house so bills are high each month. The kids have activities and don't go without:No he doesn't work at weekends but he always has chores to do - keeping on top of the house is a struggle for me. I try to factor in cleaning everyday. E.g toilets and floors one day. Skirting and dusting the next. Alongside the relentless picking up of toys and cleaning mess!!! Cooking and shopping etc. Kids presents, birthday parties ... I do the inane messaging of people but none of it impacts me. I feel like a dysfunctional robot. Sometime I do that. I pretend I'm a robot to just get through the day. It's easier than going into my mind."
Didiplanthis,Mon 27-Feb-17 19:56:32,"Oops - the OP is obviously in a bad place, could you not go a little bit easier ?OP - you sound properly depressed. I can relate to so many of those feelings. It got better with decent meds and some CBT. With my first I never left the house never went to groups and felt so very lonely and desperate - I had PND. I went back to work and actually that didn't really work out either. I now work part time. I will never be socially adept or confident and I still don't feel totally cut out for this motherhood lark but I do enjoy my children now (sometimes) and the dark times are fewer and shorter. Go and see your gp. Show them your post if you can't articulate it."
clumsyduck,Mon 27-Feb-17 20:19:19,"Oops that's what you took from this post seriously ?? Iv been a single mum most my dp life and still don't have a d""h"" . Literally didn't cross my mind to read anything into the title other than op looking for people that might relate to her .Op I don't have much to add but you do sound like you could be a bit depressed . It sounds like a lot of stuff falls on your shoulders and you don't really get any time out !"
bunnylove99,Mon 27-Feb-17 20:25:21," OP. I really feel for you. Please do make a GP appointment without delay. You sound depressed and there is plenty that can be done to help work things out for you, you just need to take that first step. You will get through this. Depression can creep up on any of us. You are isolated with young children, it's no wonder things are tough for you. Many many suffer similar. Please make the first move to seek help. You don't have to take meds from GP, go and talk to them in the first instance. Also try and get out for a walk and fresh air each day. Winter can make things so much worse. Take care. "
ssd,Mon 27-Feb-17 20:49:02," sorry meant to add, shes just back to being herself now (and she felt like she shouldnt be depressed, she has a wonderful life but was still needing anti depressants)"
SoMuchPain,Tue 28-Feb-17 13:37:21,I see a counsellor tomorrow morning. It's an early appointment I don't know how productive that will be. My assessment said i suffer from anxiety. Didn't quite label me as depressed but I guess the counsellor will let me know after an assessment tomorrow. I'm going to try the GP later - I promise I will. I just going to take a bit more strength to do that I'm worried - I don't know why. Anxious I guess about being told I have depression
MsHooliesCardigan,Wed 01-Mar-17 14:20:05," OP I'm a CPN and I've also suffered from severe depression. Please don't be so hard on yourself. Anyone can become depressed, even people with 'perfect' lives and your life sounds really hard. It's an illness and you are allowed to feel the way you do. Not everyone is cut out to be a SAHM. I have taken ADs for the majority of my adult life and they certainly haven't turned me into a zombie. They simply correct a chemical imbalance in your brain - it's no different to taking meds for an overactive thyroid. If someone who isn't depressed takes them, they won't have any effect. Hopefully they will get you to a place where your mood improves sufficiently to let you make changes in your life which will allow you to be happy in the long term. You sound like a lovely person. Good luck."
Evenstar,Fri 03-Mar-17 08:57:49,"Thank you for your replies, I have had episodes of depression and been through counselling myself, I think what I am struggling with is the fact she is presenting her own version of the truth. When I have been depressed I have been very aware that the way I was thinking wasn't right, I wouldn't have wanted to upset other people by saying things like this. I find it hard too as my late MIL was a very difficult woman who constantly presented her own version of the truth and even if several other people said that her recollection was not what had been said or happened she would never back down."
PlayOnWurtz,Wed 01-Mar-17 17:01:20,"I have a history of recurrent depressive disorder, anxiety and ocd as well aso severe post natal depression following birth of previous dc. I also have complex physical health issues and recurrent miscarriages. So I'm 6 weeks pregnant and using progesterone to help keep things in place however my mood has fallen through the floor, my anxiety is through the roof and I've lost all motivation to do anything or engage with anyone.I want to be happy.

My midwife won't speak to me until I'm 8 weeks and was dismissive of my worries when I spoke to her.Please help"
Archfarchnad,Thu 02-Mar-17 15:34:04,"I'm in Germany where it is prescribed commonly by GPs as an alternative to mild depression. I tend to get mild winter depression here so often take it in the winter months in combination with a light box on dull days.I would recommend that you only take it after consulting your GP. The danger is that people start taking it who are actually more seriously depressed than they think, and then end up not getting the help they need. You've endured a huge burden in the last year, and the doctor needs to formally diagnose you with mild - rather than medium to serious - depression first, I think. It's contraindicated by several things - the Pill is one. It increases sensitivity to sun. My mum couldn't take it because of her heart medication (but the medication also prevented her drinking cranberry juice!).A full medical dose for an adult is 900mg per day. You might need to take this as two tablets at 450 each. I find that it takes about three weeks before I notice any improvement at all, for some people it works quicker. But it's really not something that will work as a one-off (I feel better today so I won't take it, tomorrow I might etc) - you need to be consistent. In that respect, it's no different to standard ADs."
mum19821985,Wed 21-Dec-16 13:43:16," I have suffered with pmdd/severe PMS for as long as I can remember. I am due on Christmas Eve/Christmas day and this week pmdd has reared its ugly head. I am gutted! I have loads of family to see/things to organise and I have just ""crashed"". I am overwhelmed, depressed and a bit of a nightmare to be around tbh. I know in my head this will pass but it is honestly like I have some sort of personality transplant! I don't want this to ruin Christmas"
NoMudNoLotus,Wed 01-Mar-17 22:28:56,"I agree OP - call children's social care.It will be much better if you do it yourself - I'm being honest with you but it's only a matter of time before mental health services make a safeguarding referral .If you are abusing alcohol and struggling with suicidal behaviours your children as you quite rightly say need protecting from emotional harm. I am a mental health nurse and I think you will benefit greatly from the PD services - their psychological therapies are excellent.FWIW the term BPD (Now changed to EUPD ... emotionally unstable PD) is increasingly being pushed away by many mental health professionals who identify it more as being a diagnosis of complex trauma. Please enquire about DBT, distress tolerance and mentaiisation therapy ."
Itisnoteasybeingdifferent,Tue 28-Feb-17 22:04:42,"Does sound like you have borrowed my T shirt.. As anxious says, speak to your GP and you will need a referral to a specialist. Then the big question you will have to face is, ""do I want to take the meds?""From personal experience it is not an easy choice to make. Depending on which meds you will be affected to some degree. If they don't do something there is no point in taking them. They may help you manage your emotional excess. But the price is loss of genuine emotion and feeling alive (and depressed). FWIW, I choose to take my meds because I have learned that life is easier whilst medicated than it is when I am blowing over hot and rushing about trying to avoid depression,"
Wolfiefan,Wed 22-Feb-17 23:11:34, Yep. Depression. Functioning. Wading through treacle. Detached and robotic. Totally was depression for me. I thought it couldn't be. I didn't feel sad. I had nothing to be depressed about. But yep I was depressed.
Rockingaround,Thu 23-Feb-17 00:13:34,"Hi OP I have as depression since being a little girl (I'm currently on 40mg of citalopram and have been for the past 11 years) one of my first realisations/memories of ""the feeling"" was similar to what you describe, a feeling of guilt, like I'd done something terribly terribly wrong, I think I was about 9. Although I've had more than my fair share of knocks and hard times, I experienced those feelings before anything major happened in my life. I firmly believe that for many (not all) people depression is caused by the levels of seratonin our brain produces, for me I just think it's how I'm wired and the pills enable me to live a 'normal' existence. My meds increase the levels of seratonin in my brain thus enabling me to experience the happiness in my life; as opposed to only ever seeing the dark side to life - feeling low, pessimistic, hopeless, etc. It took me a long long time to come to this realisation, I spent my teens and my early twenties in a self - destructive, reckles state tbh - trying counselling, cbt, natural remedies, meditation, courses, excersise etc etc etc. I don't know if anything has happened recently to trigger these feelings for you?Depression is so complex and unforgiving, like I've said, for some of us it just looms.  Is it vaguely similar to when you had PND? And, how did you get through it then? I've never taken Prozac so not sure of how long people are prescribed it..."
Rockingaround,Thu 23-Feb-17 01:00:41,"Thank you OP I think sometimes counselling, CBT and other therapies can help some people, although for many it's just too much, too painful and something many are never ready for/able to do. One of the things that has helped me, is to abandon looking for a resolve, I got to the point where I didn't care why I felt like ill, I just needed to feel better. I found that searching and the going over of my life in therapy just made things worse - I had several therapists - I think I got the point where I thought, even if I understand why I feel like this, I'm still going to feel like this so how do I make it go away. I initially started medication to give me a break from myself/the pain; with a view to get to the bottom of it when I felt stronger. 11 years on, I couldn't care if I never ""work through"" my issues and come to terms with why I have depression. It's quite an empowering place to be, I honestly don't think there's anything wrong with being on (the right) pills forever You sound like there's a lot going on for you at the moment. There's obviously those awful memories from the experiences you've had, the feelings they conjur up which are made worse by the very present effects of the breakdown of a relationship. One compounds the other, I'm terrible if faced with a difficult time, I group all of the bad things that have ever happened to me, along with my fears - together and become enveloped in all that sadness/hopelessness. (I think that's quite typical of a depressive thought process although I only know my experiences) Id be so overwhelmed in your position, by what's happening with your partner, which is bound to dredge up a lot of other negative feelings you've had in the past and it all just piles up too high. I would probably go and see the GP. Don't feel you have to pour your heart out, just tell him/her you have a good insight into your own mental health, you're having an excruciatingly difficult time and you're a mum and you need to feel better than you do. If you want to try and see if meds can give you a break maybe? it's exhausting feeling as you are right now. I think it takes about 3 weeks for an ssri to take effect ..."
Owlzes,Mon 20-Feb-17 11:04:09,"I know you guys aren't doctors, but I know there are some smart people here and people who have worked with psychiatric services and I’m trying to work out if something is normal.So, I’m diagnosed bipolar, and on medication (lamotrigine and aripiprazole) and have a history of hospitalization, but have been stable for the last 3-4 years. Used to be diagnosed as type one, now type two (because I’ve not had a manic episode in a number of years). I’m on medication and apparently stable. I’ve been going through some stuff lately (parents in law hitting end of life stage, work stress, wedding planning stress, money stress) and it’s felt like it’s getting to me so my fiancé kicked me into talking to my CPN today.I went in and explained that I’d not been sleeping properly lately, that since Thursday I’d been tearful most days, and that on Thursday and Sunday I’d been actively suicidal and making plans to die, including one day on which I acquired the method I was thinking of using (it was an inept plan, in retrospect, but that isn’t the point). I said I felt exhausted and drained and I just wanted to be dead so I could rest, and I felt so very alone. I also said I’d self-harmed for the first time in four years. I also showed her my mood tracker in my diary and how many days I was on a 1 or 2 (I track my moods from 1-10, with 1 being suicidal and 10 being ecstatic).She said “well, that’s normal. You’ve got a lot on. You should try more exercise” and “what’s the point of that mood tracker? How can you track your own moods? You won’t be objective” and pretty much sent me on my way, with this vague sense that I was being whingy and a bit melodramatic. She didn't make another appointment to see me either, so apparently I'm not seeing her again unless I chase, although I'm still seeing my pdoc every four months. I don’t know if maybe I was just coming across as stable (I was freshly showered, with make up and nice work clothes) or it was the very neatly set up bullet journal with stickers and notes, and maybe that does mean I’m OK – her normal line is that if I think I might be unwell, I’m not. But it feels a bit too me as if I’m caught in a catch 22, as either way (either I’m too mad to know I need help, or if I know I need help, I’m not mad enough to get it) I get no support.She’s done this before – in August I had a bit of a wobble where I decided that I was getting messages from Disney songs and just needed to run until I turned into sky – where she said if I could recognize those were odd thoughts then I wasn’t actually unwell – and I’m beginning to wonder if she thinks there is anything wrong with me. Which is OK, if there is nothing wrong with me, but surely none of this is totally normal? Or is it? Am I just being melodramatic?And if it’s not normal, who am I meant to talk to? What am I meant to do? Is there any kind of alternative support structure away from a CPN that isn’t ‘whinging to my friends’? Or should I just get on with it (not the suicide, the gluing myself back together)?Any advice very gratefully received."
StumblyMonkey,Mon 20-Feb-17 18:25:36,"Absolutely not normal.It may be that she's not used to dealing with people who have significant insight into their own condition?I also have bipolar and am able to explain my thoughts and can, if not immediately, relatively quickly spot my own hypomania.I would absolutely change psychiatrists. I would actually raise a complaint once I was well enough - telling someone having strong suicidal ideations that nothing is wrong is frankly dangerous. Do you have private healthcare through work or could you afford a private psych? It's the best thing I've ever done so would highly recommend it if you can (but realise many can't unfortunately)..."
Owlzes,Mon 20-Feb-17 23:24:51,"I called today and asked if I could make an appointment with my pdoc and was told his secretary was away until next week and when she gets back I can make an appointment for the next couple of months maybe. So I gave up and am now asking for an appointment with my GP. I have talked to a friend at work (ironically, I work for a MH charity, and my boss is an ex-psych nurse) and he said she was being useless and I should ask to change CPN but I'm trying to pluck up the courage to get that in motion. I just keep thinking that if I ask to change CPN I'll be told she was right and I'm wrong and there's nothing really wrong with me and I'll be stuck with her with her being even more exasperated with me.I went into work and my boss was lovely and told me to think about whether I needed some time off or to go down to part time hours while I'm unwell. I also slept for a few hours this evening and while I got up feeling slightly giddy, I'm OK. I'm not suicidal right now - just absolutely drained. I know that depression tends to manifest in a very physical way for me - like a weight on my chest or something. And everything feels really really hard. My fiance was lovely and says that he will come with me into the CMHT if I want to make a complaint as he feels quite strongly she's being useless and he's really annoyed about the mood diary comment as he feels it's been staggeringly useful for both of us to be able to follow how my brain is working. I think I'll try talking to the GP on Weds - if I get much worse before then there is A&E. It is just so fucking hard to manage the energy to do all this."
Iris65,Tue 21-Feb-17 14:40:51,"I am really sorry that you are going through this. I have a lot of experience both as MH services user and as a (MH) professional for a period.Apart from the actual diagnosis I am very similar to you - high functioning even when very unwell and often suicidal.It is frustrating when members of the team don't seem to take you seriously but... what are you hoping for?A couple of years ago my SI was taken seriously and I was admitted for a week to an acute psychiatric ward and then endured a month of day hospital. Afterwards I saw the crisis team regularly and realised that:1) Most of the team knew a lot less than me.2) Because the team changed so often there was little continuity3) The NHS could not provide what I wanted - which was long term, high quality psychotherapyand 4) The best person to manage my condition was.....me.Now I have a plan in place for those periods when I am actively suicidal which involves telling my DP how I feel, being nice to myself, spending time with friends even when I don't want to, staying physically active, chanting positive mantras and if that doesn't help I see a private counsellor for a few sessions. Costs about the same as a weekend away. I am lucky because I have met a really good therapist and I can afford it."
Owlzes,Tue 21-Feb-17 15:28:52,"My previous CPN was amazing. Realistically, I think I got a lot of extra attention then because I was fresh out of hospital when I came to her and at first the CMHT wouldn’t take me as I was considered high risk (I had delusions, intrusive thoughts and suicidal compulsions). So they put a lot of work into me.Whereas my new CPN met me when I moved cities, had been stable for a year, and hasn’t really seen me when I’ve been very unwell. Which I sort of logically know. But it’s still a bit sucky.I don’t know. Maybe I do need to just get on with it, in which case I wonder if I’m better off just ditching the CPN and pdoc entirely. Except my GP is twitchy about prescribing my antipsychotics without them and I think I’ll get ill again if I have no meds. Argh! Sorry! I know you’re being helpful. I’m just feeling awful and am fighting the urge to collapse in a nihilistic heap."
Owlzes,Mon 20-Feb-17 11:04:09,"I know you guys aren't doctors, but I know there are some smart people here and people who have worked with psychiatric services and I’m trying to work out if something is normal.So, I’m diagnosed bipolar, and on medication (lamotrigine and aripiprazole) and have a history of hospitalization, but have been stable for the last 3-4 years. Used to be diagnosed as type one, now type two (because I’ve not had a manic episode in a number of years). I’m on medication and apparently stable. I’ve been going through some stuff lately (parents in law hitting end of life stage, work stress, wedding planning stress, money stress) and it’s felt like it’s getting to me so my fiancé kicked me into talking to my CPN today.I went in and explained that I’d not been sleeping properly lately, that since Thursday I’d been tearful most days, and that on Thursday and Sunday I’d been actively suicidal and making plans to die, including one day on which I acquired the method I was thinking of using (it was an inept plan, in retrospect, but that isn’t the point). I said I felt exhausted and drained and I just wanted to be dead so I could rest, and I felt so very alone. I also said I’d self-harmed for the first time in four years. I also showed her my mood tracker in my diary and how many days I was on a 1 or 2 (I track my moods from 1-10, with 1 being suicidal and 10 being ecstatic).She said “well, that’s normal. You’ve got a lot on. You should try more exercise” and “what’s the point of that mood tracker? How can you track your own moods? You won’t be objective” and pretty much sent me on my way, with this vague sense that I was being whingy and a bit melodramatic. She didn't make another appointment to see me either, so apparently I'm not seeing her again unless I chase, although I'm still seeing my pdoc every four months. I don’t know if maybe I was just coming across as stable (I was freshly showered, with make up and nice work clothes) or it was the very neatly set up bullet journal with stickers and notes, and maybe that does mean I’m OK – her normal line is that if I think I might be unwell, I’m not.

Iris65,Wed 22-Feb-17 20:00:23,"Asking for a mood swing! 😂 I never get manic, just agitated depression rather than depression on its own. TBH I'd rather be depressed than agitated - but mania could be fun??!! 😉🎉🎉🎉Hope you got on OK with GP. Your list looks really useful."
clairethewitch70,Tue 28-Feb-17 20:27:45,"My mental health is plummeting quickly. I have BPD, depression and anxiety. Because of my physical deterioration my depression is suddenly becoming worse.Scared I will become suicidal again, I become impulsive and can go from not suicidal to very, quickly.I am spending more and more time in bed, and when working, I am present in body but not in mind. I am taking the day off tomorrow. We own our own business so I won't get sacked, but obviously work will build up.Several things have caused this flare up. A cold several weeks ago have impacted energy levels, then 3 weeks ago today I had day surgery on my spine. PIP forms have had to be completed (I was on lifetime award DLA), and I am stressed about that.My DH is very supportive, but I know he can only pick up so much slack from me. He has long term health issues too.Hand hold please."
winekeepsmesane,Tue 28-Feb-17 21:50:31,"Hi, sorry, I don't have any advice despite a similar situation, but I wonder what your triggers are? I can spiral within minutes but (luckily I guess) I'm very aware of my triggers and can usually relatively fix things. Do u think that u could fit in another gp appointment? Applying for pip is ridiculously difficult, have u got an advisor to help u? I obviously can't personally help but I really hope u find a way to counteract the suicidal thoughts. I'm well aware that the ONLY reason I've not ever (fully) acted on mine is because I've seen and felt the other side of it. If u ever need to talk to alleviate some symptoms feel free to pm or just talk on here x"
clairethewitch70,Tue 28-Feb-17 22:12:15,"My triggers are usually stress based, and also when my physical health deteriorates. Seeing GP next week, if I ring I can't usually get in with the same GP and don't get the level of support with other Dr's at the surgery.I sent the PIP forms off yesterday, took my over a week to fill in, provided lots of letters which my GP printed off for me, but I am still expecting to lose it. I am not actively suicidal but don't want to go there again. Last time I was taken off a motorway bridge by Police back to MH ward. Thank you wine & nolonger"

Elvander,Fri 24-Feb-17 20:27:44,"I started taking Sertraline for PND after the birth of my daughter - stayed on them for 6 months, felt better so stopped. This turned out to be a big mistake and 6 months later I was back on the ADs. I've taken them for over a year now and have felt ""well"" for a good 6 months so I decided it was time to stop again.I've been taking 50mg and since this is the lowest therapeutic dose, I was advised by my GP first time round just to stop taking them. I felt pretty miserable for a few weeks, so this time I've halved the dose, with the intention of stopping completely after a month or so. Felt fine for the first week after I reduced the dose, felt nauseous and exhausted for the second week, and now on the third week I'm really struggling. I'm alternating between feeling total RAGE, and feeling utterly overwhelmed and suffocated by my life. This is a million times worse than last time I came off ADs, and I haven't even stopped completely yet!I would be interested to hear other people's experiences of Sertraline withdrawal. I'm hoping that this is just a period of adjustment while my brain gets used to not having as much Sertraline, but part of me is terrified that I've actually turned into this awful, angry, ungrateful person and the drugs have just been masking it... I'm really struggling to cope with everything - it all just feels like too much. I'm not feeling suicidal or anything like that, but I am having random thoughts about running away from it all which I haven't had in a long, long time.Please give me hope that the old me is still in there and this will pass soon!"
Joto369,Tue 28-Feb-17 23:16:35, Grrrrrrr  two panic attacks in the last half an hour. Managed to calm myself down with distraction and a chat with son in Oz but it's so bloody frustrating. I went for the acupuncture assessment but it was a Chinese place and they said I also needed herbal medicine at a cost of 45 a week. Plus the acupuncture cost = 90 a week. Not a chance! !! I asked for just acupuncture and he said no it would have to be both. I'm looking elsewhere. I'm still getting the awful spaced feeling in the day which clears up eventually and the anxiety is not as bad as it was but don't feel depressed at all. I'm guessing it's all still the stress of my husbands infidelity and the car accident and my stress trigger being too high! Will watch some rubbish tv til I nod off
OurMiracle1106,Mon 27-Feb-17 22:05:07,"I suffer from epilepsy. Both absence and tonic clinic seizures. I have absences a few times a week, sometimes it's harmless-watching tele I miss a minute of a programme other times falling down stairs burning myself walking in a road. Apparently I'm safe to go out alone as the absences aren't frequent enough and ""whilst they can understand why I would prefer someone with me they doubt it could cause any anxiety"" despite having been hit by a car lucky to be alive as a result I wasn't awarded either when it was reassessed. On top of that they sent my letter to the wrong address and 3 months later I'm still waiting for my mandatory reconsideration. The assessor came to my home. Was early. Didn't take down all my medications. Wrongly documented my last seizures. Forgot to mention me being around strange men is very hard. (I work in an office of a children's centre there's 2 admins. Both female) due to past experiences. I can manage. Just without it. But I can no longer afford my counselling so it's a matter of time before I end up depressed and suicidal again."
Scribblegirl,Wed 22-Feb-17 18:25:29,"Any other sufferers out there?Sometimes mine is under control and sometimes it's insane. My anxiety is on a flare at the moment and my hands, lips and mouth look appalling from picking and biting at them. I also have a section on my nose I can't stop with, pretty sure my colleagues think I'm a compulsive bogey picker...I really struggle to think of it as a mental health thing. I've had various informal diagnoses between anxiety and OCD in the past (although the best fit for my symptoms I've personally found is borderline) but nothing's stuck and I've usually managed to flit between services without getting sorted. I have moments of proper despair but by the time an appointment for anything comes around I'm coping a bit better and cancel, or feel like a fraud for sitting through the appointment, probably getting labelled a time waster  Despite (or perhaps because of) a couple of suicide attempts in my teens and self harm issues (although I've not cut in a few years and now just scratch myself) I can't see compulsive picking as a 'problem' in the same way. Family and friends just think of it as an irritating habit. When DP and I first met he used to bat my hands away when I started to pick until I told him how patronising I find it. Now he just reminds me to stop - as he knows sometimes it's something I'm doing subconsciously - but that's easier said than done.It's weird, I'm actually feeling on a decent keel at this very second but but I can't stop ripping at my skin. Sigh."
CherryBlini,Mon 06-Feb-17 10:31:54,"Yes i suffer and I don't know what to do about it really but I'm trying to help myself! My HA started when both my parents were diagnosed with cancer .. so I know the root cause. This leads me to think that therapy won't help - what's the point? I know what's causing it! The 'sane' side of my brain tells me that what I'm thinking is completely mad. I KNOW that the fact I've got a painful back doesn't mean it's some sort of secondary cancer. I absolutely know that. I know that the fact my left breast aches doesn't mean cancer - it probably means hormonal changes as I'm 45 now. I keep telling myself this and I really do know it. It's just a shame the HA keeps popping up all the bloody time. I'm dealing with it by trying to eat well, taking up yoga and reading more. Having a relaxing bath. I'm considering reflexology and I might look into the Headspace app. I won't go to the doctor and waste his/her time because I know I have HA and not a brain tumour - although the brain tumour was last month  I am going to try and beat this without any medication .. I'm not depressed or mad - I've just got this damn HA and I know full well what's brought it on.

sadandanxious,Mon 27-Feb-17 13:53:24,"I have BPD and the laziness and not parenting really don't sound like typical symptoms of BPD. Either he's slipped back into depression massively or he's using it as an excuse. Honestly I find parenting exhausting when I'm depressed but no matter how shit I feel I would always make sure my DSD is fed, teeth brushed, story read before bed etc. Mind you maybe he is just finding it too much, everyone responds differently. Regardless of his reasons is sounds awful for you! Have you thought about or suggested couples counselling?"
happyfrown,Mon 27-Feb-17 20:40:02,"I am the flip side of your post. I have BPD and ended a long relationship with dp because of it. he was told about my mental health when we met and honestly supported me through thick and thin. but I couldn't stand the guilt of him having to put up with me, im hard to live with to the point I refused him to live with me for the years we were together. your H maybe depressed but even people with bpd / depression still manage to do basic parenting as hard and draining it maybe. are you sure its completely his illness and not part taking the advantage of you?no one can tell you to leave or stay as they are not the ones dealing with the outcome. you have to decide whats best for everyone, if your worried about how your H will care for the dc if you leave is there not a way of seeing through contact centre due to your concern for their safety with his mental health state?"
TerrorTwilight,Mon 27-Feb-17 12:11:26,"Hi everyone. I'm a man. Sorry about that. I hope you don't mind me posting here.I've just returned from a 4 week absence from work. I'm a teacher (a deputy head, actually). Been back a week. Half my issue is I seem to other people to be coping most of the time, but what's under the surface is this boiling terror. I nearly wigged out completely at work this morning and a kind colleague very kindly managed to talk me down again. But nobody else really sees that, and I feel like it makes me seem like a fake. Background: I had a really serious anxiety attack in my previous job back in July. I took a week off work but went back before I was really ready, and feel like I've never properly healed. I have a history of depression; the anxiety is new (or at least newly acknowledged: I think it's always been there).Anyway. My brain tells me I'm not good enough, that I'll be found out, that everyone thinks I'm shit, that I'm letting everyone down. (It doesn't help that my marriage is seriously on the ropes.) When I feel like this I often think everyone would be better off without me around. I wouldn't class this as suicidal, as I don't seriously consider doing anything about it: much too scared to actually hurt myself. But if I were to, like, evaporate painlessly I feel like most of the people in my life would be better off. The only thing that gives me pause is my wonderful daughters, and that stops me from taking that thought anywhere past the initial impulse reaction to my uselessness. I'm a good daddy. I actually do know that. It's the only thing I know.I'm medicated (20mg Citalopram) and having weekly therapy. I do feel better than 4 weeks ago: the flat featureless depression I had (which wasn't the depth of black despair I've experienced in the past) has mostly lifted. But I am very anxious about work, because I loathe it. With a passion.And half of what's scaring me is that I seem to be stuck with one or the other: marriage or work. If my marriage fails, I have to stay in my job to be able to financially support my babies. If I end up having to quit my job, I won't be able to support myself, much less them. It feels like Catch 22. Does it get better? I can't feel like this any more. It's killing me."
W8woman,Mon 27-Feb-17 21:31:41,"Saved my life. I had ADs and every kind of therapy going, privately and on the NHS, and was agoraphobic and suicidal.

My assailants have never been caught. I have crystal clear recall, no flashbacks and only a few flash-forwards. I still occasionally suffer OCD anxiety (untouched by the EMDR) but have had that since I was a kid and now think it's just my personality type."

Also when I was depressed and felt very low one of the things my counsellor got me to do (eventually) was to find something that relaxed me, something which took my mind to a different place, mine turned out to be playing 2 games on my tablet - Hay Day & Township - I still play them now - they engross me, when I play them the world seems to switch off around me. I do also enjoy doing the adult colouring but it doesn't relax me as much. Good luck - I hope you get the right answers soon"

I came across things id saved for future projects and most of the wood had bowed and twisted from standing up.I felt overwhelmed with all this mess and stuff I don't have the mental energy for. where as before it was like gold dust, like my treasure!

Orangecake123,Thu 23-Feb-17 19:46:32,I was suicidal and had severe depression. I started therapy twice a week a month ago. It was something that i had tried before when I was younger but I never found helpful to be honest and the main thing is found why was the connection you have with your therapist. I found mine on:www.itsgoodtotalk.org.uk/I sent a very frank and brief outline of the main issues I was struggling with. My advice would be don't be afraid to ask questions or to message more than one at a time. There are a lot of different types of therapy. My deciding factor was just based on the way my therapist responded back to my original message. It really hasn't been easy but today I left feeling good. It's just about helping you get better.

AnxiousMunchkin,Sat 27-Feb-16 09:40:25,I'll keep talking to myself. I did a test last night and this morning and both negative. But still no AF. 9 days late now. If this is a side effect of sertraline I'm really worried because I can't be coping with this worry that I might be pregnant every month. But sertraline was the last antidepressant that I was happy to try. Although I'm actually taking it for anxiety. But I will not take paroxetine or fluoxetine again as I became suicidal on them. Citalopram was not effective for me. Venlafaxine worked well I thought but then I overdosed on it and it caused a seizure so I think that's out again now. Sertraline is the only one that the GP offered me that I was happy to try. I expected some side effects but affecting my cycles like this is too much of a worry that its counterproductive if the whole point is to help manage my anxiety. It's so frustrating.
AnxiousMunchkin,Sat 27-Feb-16 10:49:21,"Oh goodness. Hello. I feel a bit embarrassed now like I've been discovered mumbling to myself in a darkened room The plan is to go up to 100mg but my GP wanted to start very low and ease up because of my previous experience of suicidal ideation on some other SSRIs. I realise that GAD would be a diagnosis but I'm not sure if that's my diagnosis IYSWIM. She tends to say ""if"". I'm trying to commit myself to the plan of staying on this for at least a few months at the proper dose to give it a proper try. But I'm worried because I really don't need any other things to fuel anxiety I'm perfectly capable of finding millions of things to worry and obsess about without adding to it! It's confusing though I can't find amennorrhoea listed as a side effect of sertraline. But my cycles have never been disrupted before and I've been going through stress and anxiety for some time. I am worried about developing suicidal thoughts again. I don't have any at the moment. But I have started to think about self harm and that's not something I've done for probably a decade. Just the idea of causing some physical pain as a focus, something real to concentrate on."
Eulalia2,Wed 22-Feb-17 21:35:19," Eldest son has mild autism but has had additional mental health problems for over a year now. His Dad (my husband) died nearly 15 months ago. I am struggling with being on my own with him, age 17, daughter 14 and youngest son 11. This year my mother was also very ill and I had a lot of stress at work. Just had nearly 4 weeks off work with stress/depression and am now taking anti depressants. I managed to summon up a bit of effort to talk to my son at the weekend (been ignoring each other mostly). He revealed he had been cutting himself. He showed me his scars on his arm. They were more like deep scratches. I didnt really look at them properly. For some stupid reason when I saw them I thought ""is that it?' Like thinking they weren't that bad. I felt no other emotion, shock, sympathy or anything. We talked about emotions and he seems to be feeling the same. I didnt reveal my thoughts and didnt really register it until later. I realised that my reaction was not right for a mother. I know I am depressed but really is this the sort of thing people do? I just don't seem to care about anything any more and even worse I don't seem to care that I don't care. It's taken me a lot of effort to even type this."
NolongerAnxiousCarer,Wed 22-Feb-17 21:59:30,"Firstly who knows how they would react to this till it happens, the lack of emotion could be shock in itself. Also when we are depressed we can just feel so numb, that we can't feel anything.For me self harm is a coping mechanism to release the pressure that builds up inside when stress gets too much. Sometimes it can be a way of feeling something when you are feeling too numb inside. The severity of the injury does not necessarily reflect the severity of the emotional turmoil. I rarely break the skin, but the intensity of the urges and the internal anguish is completely unbearable to get me to that point in the first place. Also generally over time you need to cut deeper to get the same relief and it can be addictive.You need to get proffesional help for both of you ASAP. Get youself and your son to the GP and get some help."
Eulalia2,Thu 23-Feb-17 18:27:53," Thanks again will have a look at that link, am far too tired just now, was home late as had training after work and trying not to go to bed too early. I think part of the problem is that I have totally lost perspective, I feel that I don't have any real problems, that I am 'making' myself depressed, I feel guilty and that I don't deserve any attention but at the same time am seeking it... its very childlike. I found myself making attachments to people at work today, the ones that were sympathetic, wanting to be with them. I've never actually told one single professional the whole story of the difficulties of the last 2 years, my dad being ill and dying, then my husband, my son being ill, then my mother, stress at work and trying to run a household single handed (with poor living conditions thrown in - Long story). I just wish I could cry, I've not been able to do that for weeks now."
dangermouseisace,Tue 02-Aug-16 23:34:21, There are some people who get depression from the pill or other drugs- my uncle got depressed on an anti-inflammatory! My friend had to have her IUD taken out because if was affecting her mood. It might be worthwhile using other forms of contraception for a while and see if your mood continues to improve.
showsomeclass,Wed 03-Aug-16 13:00:21,"Thanks guysWhat's silly is that I don't actually use it for contraception as my DP has had 'the snip'! It's for period control, which is works brilliantly for! But oh my days - sometimes I feel suicidal and so out of control of my own feelings"
misiabella,Thu 23-Feb-17 18:31:23," I got so bad on Cerelle that in the end I had very disturbing, and very real suicidal thoughts. I took it for about 8 months and it was hell. Constant spotting was the least of my problems. I was in constant anxiety, I would cry in the car after dropping kids at school, constant fog and inability to gather my thoughts. I had moments wen I was extremely angry and had to really control myself. I was irrational and emotional. I almost divorced my husband. Finally I couldn't even sleep at night as my head was full of anxiety and suicide looked to me like a very tempting option. With the last of my sense I went to gp to change it back to cerazzete which I used to be fine with (before they decided to save some money and changed it to cerelle) The effect of cerelle worn off within a few weeks, but even after the first week the difference was huge. They are supposed to be the same, but there is something in cerelle that gave me anxiety/depression."
mycavitiesareempty,Thu 16-Feb-17 19:27:43,"My kids are too old for rota virus vaccine. They have both had their share of stomach bugs but often these are just 3-4 vomits and then that'sounds it. Sometimes diarrhea too. One of these must have been rota. OP can I gently suggest that you are probably more depressed than you realise. Women, IMHO, can be really quite severely depressed ( and this includes predominantly anious-type depression) while appearing to function. We have to. Do you want to tell us about your life more generally? It'seems a good bunch on here. Lots of people who have been in similar situations send come out the other side."
SloanePeterson,Fri 17-Feb-17 08:36:11," Op, I want to tell you, the you of the future won't recognise the you of right now. The cbt and the tablets WILL help you. I was you 8 years ago. My second child was about 14 months old and I was falling apart, scared to leave the house but scared to stay in it, convinced that something truly awful was going to happen to me either way. I didn't open my post for over a year which caused all sorts of problems, I just shoved it all into a suitcase under my bed, so convinced that every letter would have terrible news in it. When I eventually did go to my gp I had to wait ten months for cbt, which helped enormously, and has helped me since too, it really helped me learn to handle life. Until that kicked in, I was prescribed some anti anxiety meds. I think j tried maybe here different ones before finding the one that was like a light being switched on. It worked. And tbh, ds is now diagnosed with autism, it's still a huge struggle every day, but I've never been back to those terrible depths of despair. I was surprised when my cbt therapist told me I had ocd. I was convinced that that meant obsessively cleaning. What it actually means is unhelpful, obtrusive, obsessive thoughts, which I had by the bucketful. This WILL pass. But you need to be honest with yourself and the people around you. I was a single parent, and had friends around who were aware of what I was struggling with and that really helped. I also had an awesome cbt therapist who knew I had no childcare and scheduled our sessions for when ds was most likely to nap, I'd walk the long way round to the surgery with him in his buggy and more often than not he'd be sound asleep when we got there. You don't have to put up with feeling like this. It isn't a weakness in you, and it's not something you asked for or deserve. It's just crappy thing that happens to some of us sometimes. Please at least try some tablets, if hey don't work then try some different ones. They saved my life."
Skatingonthinice16,Sat 18-Feb-17 22:40:36,"It does but I can't imagine it ever being me. I am so hopelessly stuck. Ds wants to go out tomorrow for the day so I will have to express in the car both ways and I hate that. It's all such hard work. And even whilst we are out it will be hard work. There's no pleasure in it, I just wait for it to be over so I can go home. Then I just wait for the day to be over so I can go to bed. All the time I'm just waiting for it to be over. The diabetes must have been a huge worry for my parents - I worry about passing it on to my dc too. I think that might be the actual end of me. I used to be very careful and really look after myself but now I don't care. If it knocks a few extra years off my lifespan then it's all good."
InfinityPlusOne,Sat 18-Feb-17 22:58:23,"Skating you are suffering from depression and anxiety from what I am reading. You've been advised by many posters now to go and get help. I know you've spoken to your GP already but I can't imagine you've explained the depth of your feelings, if you had I believe you would have already received more help. Lots of us think you would benefit from medication. There have also been repeated posts advising you to stop expressing, or at a minimum stop doing it so frequently. There is no need to keep doing it so often and you are just punishing yourself keeping up that timetable. I think you would see that if you weren't so deeply depressed. You really do need help, is there no one you can talk to amongst your friends and family?"
midsummabreak,Sun 19-Feb-17 10:43:00,"InfinityPlusone Your words echo my thoughts. Having gone through feeling in the depths of despair when my children were young, I too, 'get' how utterly crap it is that your DH refuses to acknowledge his role in supporting both you and your children.Your dH appears to be the typical oldfashioned 1950's style 'absent father' I hope he can 'get on board' more, and if not, that you feel OK to open up to your Mum and Dad that you need support? None of us can get through it alone. Please consider reaching out to others too- be it a support group, trusted Dr/nurse/psychologist/social worker"
Alexandra1988,Thu 23-Feb-17 11:29:33,"I've never contributed to mumsnet before but running out of options for help! I have a 'mild' scoliosis 16degree cobb angle diagnosed at 16, apparently didn't progress so no action taken. I went about my twenties not thinking about it at all, dressing how I liked with no one ever commenting on the appearance of my back. Recently (well the last year) I've been suffering with a variety of rubbish-not sure if I'm depressed, anxious, got medical health anxiety or what. Anyway at present I am utterly obsessed with the appearance of my back. I'm sure it has got more pronounced and like a clever girl I set about taking lots of photos and videos of my back in a variety of positions. Cue utter horror to see what I view as a large hump on my right side. My DH when I pointed this out to him said he had never noticed and there was nothing wrong with me. Informed him I actually had scoliosis so there was- he told me I looked fine. Unfortunately I have spent the last month continuing to video, photograph etc and some days I think it looks ok, some days it looks positively deformed. I suppose the point of my post is to see if anyone else has a) scoliosis or b) similar varying views on how they look. Im not getting a lot of sympathy ('I'm sick of you crying about your bloody back when there's nothing wrong with it') and there's no one who understands that silly as it might seem, it is real to me.

sadandanxious,Wed 22-Feb-17 13:35:43,"I saw the psychiatrist yesterday as everything has been getting too much. I have a diagnosis of depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder and have had that for a while. I self harmed on Sunday for the first time in months and I've been getting lots of suicidal thoughts but I honestly don't think I'd act on them. I've not been sleeping well lately, I can't concentrate or focus on anything and I've been having lots of angry outbursts. I'm seeing a counsellor at the moment and we're working through trauma using EMDR therapy and I'm finding it really tough going. I'm not coping with work and have had so much time off recently and I feel so bad about that. Psych wants to up my quetiapine to 150 mg (from 25 mg) and thinks that'll help wth my moods, anger and sleep. I went up to 50 mg yesterday as it's to go up slowly and I'm so exhausted today. He also said if I feel like harming again to call the crisis team and they can get me in and see if I need to stay in hospital or if I'd be allowed to go home. I feel thats very melodramatic. I've self harmed on and off for years and never once spoken to the crisis team.I feel so rubbish today, very low mood, exhausted and I've barely done any work. I don't know what I want from this. I feel like I need support but I don't really know what that looks like and I've no idea how to deal with all these negative and overwhelming feelings "

xoasemarald,Tue 21-Feb-17 15:46:52,"I really don't know what to do :/My DH was diagnosed azoopsermic in October, the news came as a huge blow to him. he is currently on anti-depressants, is supposed to be doing an online CBT course and having counselling sessions. He has had 2 or 3 phone appointments with a counsellor, and has access to services 24hrs a day, where he can ring in and get support.He's been having suicidal thoughts. He's been signed off work with stress and is currently moping about doing not much, despite seemingly being positive about some jobs he has to do around the house to keep him busy.Basically, I fell like I'm getting no support for this - on a few levels 1) acknowledging/accepting that we might not have children, if he doesn't come round to the idea of sperm donor/adoption, which won't happen for along time if his mental health is low. (I'm just turned 34, tick tock...) it's HARD2) No support about how to cope with a depressed spouse that at times is suicidal3) no support for 'me' and how this is affecting me. I feel like crying all the time."
NolongerAnxiousCarer,Tue 21-Feb-17 21:24:43,"Hi,It can be really hard supporting someone with their MH problems. I support DH with serious MH issues and know how hard it is to see someone you love so poorly. I'm also a similar age and feel the pressure of that ticking clock.I'm taking it that your DPs depression stems from his diagnosis and he is participating in treatment, so I think TENSHIs comments are unecessarily harsh. Parents with mental illness can be good parents, just the same as parents with any other illness. ( Both DHs MH team and the children of DHs relative with the same condition assure me of this ) Besides depression is treatable and there is every chance that with time your partner will recover well. Right now your DP is probably grieving for is diagnosis and I suspect you are too.Do you have any support for you? Can you access councelling through work or your GP?The most important thing we can do for ourselves and the people we support is to look after ourselves. If we go under we can't support anyone else. Its really important to make time for you, and to do the things that you enjoy. For me it's going to the gym, but anything that you enjoy. As for supporting him when he is suicidal I have plenty of experience here too unfortunately, and also experience of feeling suicidal many years ago myself. If there is an imediate danger then if possible pursuade him to either phone the crisis team (I'm assuming thats the 24/7 number he has) or to go to A&E with you. If you don't think that you can keep him safe call 999. Another way I have accessed urgent (not immediate) help has been via 111 who sent out an out of hours GP. Samaritans are also available for both of you 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org As for day to day one of the best things you can do is to do and talk about normal stuff. If he can set himself little goals to get him through the day then fab, even if its just having a shower, getting dressed etc. Exercise can really help, as it releases your bodies natural antidepressants. Getting motivation to do it when you are depressed is really tough though. But things like going for a walk can help you to feel better.Feel free to PM me if you want."

Melaniefhappy,Wed 15-Jul-09 21:06:03,"Hi everyone,I totally empathise with all said below. I had a great career, followed by a period as a very happy and busy independent consultant. WE then decided to have children but so far, ONE of us has a satisfying, enjoyable, stimulating career, and the other one battles depression on a daily basis. I know that I am not SAHM material but early on, with two kids very close together, we could not afford simultaneous nursery fees (over £2000 in our area, per month). I could not continue in consultancy due to the hours but a part-time role would not have covered the £2K a month (pre tax). Now my youngest is going to school in Sept and I am delighted (as is she) but I know that if I want to return to work for someone else it will be ME that does it all ....AND work! By this I mean it will be ME doing the packed lunches, book bags, getting kids up, ironing outfits, driving to school, and all other admin as necessary- all before work then it will be (you guessed it) ...ME picking up kids - oh an 18 hour day YIPPIE!!! Just to get some intellectual stimulation and not to be alone 24/7. The loneliness I feel is crippling. Believe me I am trying everything to find a solution. At every step it is my life that comes last. He cannot drive to school due to working 1.5 hours away. When the children were tiny I genuinely felt suicidal and would call him to bring home a bottle of wine (which I would polish off). I still feel incredibly trapped, professionally resentful and deceived. I wish I had the energy to write a book for women trying to decide whether to have children ....confirming that if men they say they'll be involved they WON'T BE as they CAN'T BE!!! Society, and the way jobs work, means that men cannot support us as they wish to, and the extended family has more or less decided to follow golf, art or another lovely activity. It was the latter that I found overwhelming also- the grandparents that I had asked for support PRE birth were not surely those that buggered off and played golf POST birth. Too selfish to help regularly is the reality- ours all live locally (less than five miles) but have golf, art, riding etc!!!!. If they knew how close they had come to not having a daughter in law to cook the sodding Christmas lunch then perhaps they would have helped more, instead of (one set in particular) waiting for their perfect daughter to finally produce offspring (which I know they would find it in their heart to help with). SORRY!!! Too much wine and feeling so trapped. Amazed that mumsnet features suicide/mental health help at the start of this section. Why doesn't society realise just how awful it is to educate women, give them career freedom and then imprison them at home as there is no way to combine two careers by working part-time each and pay the mortgage etc?Thanks for readingTired, lonely, love the kids but wish WE looked after them instead of ME ALL THE TIME."
slowreadingprogress,Sun 26-Jul-09 18:45:04,"Zahora, I really think that you need a revolution in your house. You are clearly either very depressed or utterly unsuited to be a full time mum. Nothing wrong with either of those things! What IS wrong is letting your child be brought up in that atmosphere (""ds is upset and holds me with terror saying 'mummy'"") I honestly think if your DH refuses to step in and take over that you could do something like sell up, downsize, rent - whatever it takes to get you able to leave the house and get him cared for by someone who wants to care for him. I think that's the best thing you could do for him and there is again, nothing wrong in the best person NOT being you. (in future, the best person may well be you, why the hell not? Kids change alot and as parents we all have strengths in different areas and at different times)the other thing that occurs to me is to write down for your GP what you have said about how you are with your ds. I am unqualified to say whether you are depressed or not but to be honest your doctor needs all the facts to make a proper diagnosis. If you can gird your loins to act now, I think the benefits will come to you in the future; happy you, happy ds....and again, it may take some loin-girding but your DH needs to HELP YOU!"
Sasha506,Mon 27-Jul-09 10:42:34,"I absolutely identify will all of the postings here. I wasn't at all sure that I wanted children. I had no experience of them as I was the youngest in the family (at 35!) My husband desperately wanted them, though and his mother and my mother deserately wanted grandchildren so I was made to feel like some sort of pariah for hesitating. I thought ""why not?"" and went ahead, then I found out why not. I had a daughter at 35 and another daughter at 37. They are now 21 and 19. I have photographs of us all as a family when they were 5 and 3 years old and I look as though I am suicidal, and I felt it too. My older daughter only became livable with when she left home and went to university, but she still comes home for extended stays in the holidays and we still clash like we always have. The main problems have been with my younger daughter who was born with mild learning difficulties. The problems have been catastrophic and still are. The only way I have survived this long is to keep working - I hung on to my job with my fingernails, even when most of my salary was going on nursery fees. My advice to anyone thinking about having children late in life is this - unless children mean the world to you, unless you think your life would not be complete without them and unless you can accept the complete loss of life as you knew it - dont do it!! And yes, if I could turn back the clock 22 years I wouldn't have done it, either."
LadyG,Tue 02-Feb-10 21:42:44,Zahora I don't 'buy it ' 100% either but I don't think you have to in order to benefit. I imagine getting to that place of equilibrium where one can really see the joy in everyday is a slow process! However I do feel sometimes it helps me regain a sense of perspective when dealing with the multiple trivial but trying things that children bring to ones life... Speaking as someone who has been pretty depressed recently you do sound depressed. For me it was the realisation that even things that ought to be 'pleasurable' eg spending time with family and friends even getting some time shopping on my own (took a day off work to go Christmas shopping) seemed worthless and a burden. This has made me realise that I am in a depression albeit 'reactive' and this negative person is not the one that I want to be for the rest of my life.When I do manage to 'switch off' my crazy mind it does give me so much relief and I have had 'glimpses' of that pure pleasure you speak of.  Can you try sleep management techniques? (won't give you advice about that as my four and a half year old regularly gets into our bed-I don't even wake up so haven't been able to do much about it-the 18 month old is a darling and never gets up....)How about counselling? Further study either with a view to work or purely for pleasure? A book club? Rediscovering old interests? I used to really love music and hadn't listened to anything new for 5 years or so. Spent the last couple of months discovering and downloading new or 'new to me' bands-online in my kitchen. I relate to your feelings so much and would have felt as you do had I become a stay at home mum-and I am sure so many many others do and hopefully will be along with words of greater wisdom..

Turnip713,Tue 03-Aug-10 08:13:23,"I know this is politically incorrect advice, but if you keep looking at your suitcases and fantasizing about taking off, maybe you should. At least for a little while. What you're doing now isn't working for anyone, why not try something drastic? Things sound pretty drastic right now anyway. See if your husband can take the kid for a month or two or six, and go travel the world. Pack your bags and go to Paris or something. It may get the yearning for your old life out of your system. Maybe it'll give you perspective and you'll realize that you really do want to be a mother. Or maybe you'll realize that you never want to go back and you can reach a new arrangement with your husband. Maybe you could move out and take the kid on weekends and your husband could be the primary caregiver on weekdays? Your marriage (I know this sounds cynical) sounds like it's basically over anyway, so why not divorce and split custody? You can't give your child back, that is wrong, but turning into the worst version of yourself isn't going to do the kid any favors either, and you do sound kind of schizo(your words, not mine). Whichever you choose, time away would give you perspective and time to think, which it sounds like you desperately need. I don't think you're depressed. Depression is when you have a mental illness where even though nothing is wrong, you can't feel happy. It is usually accompanied by fatigue. You don't sound depressed, you sound genuinely unhappy. I'm actually not sure how qualified I am to give this advice since I'm not actually a mother. A big part of the reason I am not a mother is because the only reaction I can realistically imagine myself having to motherhood is exactly the one you've described above, right down to the feeling hollow part. Some people just aren't meant to be domesticated."

Sadglitter,Thu 17-Feb-11 12:43:06,"I have been searching on the web for some women that were brave enough to break the taboo of not talking about how they really feel about having children, when i found this. I have wept my way through the posts, and feel that the way I truly feel inside is the thing that i have to go with. I am nearly 35 and have never wanted kids (i knew this with certainty since i was 9!!)I am now married to an amazing man, who is caring, and loving and gentle, and wants kids.... I have never wanted kids. I think he was hoping that I would change my mind as I got older. We celebrate our 7 year anniversary (get togher)tomorrow and have been married for 2 1/2yrs. I have spent the last 3 trying to convince myself that having a child would be ok. I wouldnt loose my mind, and hate every waking moment of my life - it would work out, except I am filled with a terrible and deep sense of dread & doom about this and have been suffering from depression and feel suicidal a lot now, and really dont want to. After speaking with friend who has just had a kid and regrets it deeply, i have realised that I cant do this, and have a child to please him, and on the weekend of our anniversary I am thinking about breaking up our happy marriage, and am totally distraught and soul destroyed, but know that I am trying to do the right thing for both of us, so he can have the family he has always wanted. My thoughts are with you, and hope it gets easier."
lastminute,Wed 09-Nov-11 10:44:51,"Wow, it's so good to read this thread. I feel for you all who cannot come to terms with their choice to have children. It is such a taboo to even consider not to have them that I fully understand why you decided to go for it. But you can only find out how it is for you when you have them, so don't ever blame yourself, just try to make the most of it for your kids and try to find time for you.My story is a bit different. I have a husband who is 10 years younger than I am and we started talking about having a child when we met and I was 37. I never really had the strong feeling I wanted to become a mother. I have 4 older sisters and many friends who all have children, so during the years I have baby sitted many and seen so much of what it all entitles. So I always doubted if this was good for me. I have always had a good career, travelled the world, partied a lot, love my own time. But with a husband who is 10 years younger I started to think this might be a good thing to do to have a child. He wanted it, but not so strong as to stop smoking for instance, so that made me frustrated, because we had to go through a hospital procedure when it turned out his seed wasn't the best. I stopped smoking, had 5 years of treatments on and off, which made me very unstable due to hormones, miscarriages, operations etc. He just lived his live..At 42 years old the hospital told us to stop treatments, so I felt completely relieved in some way that I tried, wouldn't regret not trying and it didn't work out for us. So we made plans for the future without kids and he was fine with this. Than...I became naturally pregnant at 44! I was panicking, couldn't feel good about this pregnancy, felt too old, not capable of doing this anymore. Everyone told me I look so young and that it would be ok and I would be a good mum. But I didn't feel that way, I became depressed, slept all day, wouldn't see anyone. My husband wanted to keep the baby, but I just couldn't connect with the feeling I was becoming a mum. He said I was negative and should focus on all the good things it would bring to our life. He also said that the first two years would really be my responsibility because he was too busy in his job...at 44 I was afraid I couldn't find the energy anymore, no way! I also thought of being 50 and have a 5 year old, 60 and have a teenager in the house, holidays with one child bored next to us or having to bring somebody else their kid on our holiday to make it nice for the kid... I come from a large family and all I could think of is that this wasn't what I envisioned to be my life and also not for the child. And after months of thinking decided to end the pregnancy...It was sheer horror, hell, something you do not wish your worst enemy to go through. Especially since my husband dropped me of at the hospital and left me alone to go through the procedure and started calling me that he was crying when it was too late..it was so painful. But now the good thing. I feel very relieved that I took this decision and trusted my own feelings. It is difficult now with my husband, but he seems to understand my decision. For him it is so different, he has no friends with babies, hasn't seen what I saw what they go through. That is how many people start with kids, very naive, no idea what they are getting into.There is such a social pressure everywhere that having kids is magical and the best thing there is in life. Think of my parents in law who didn't sleep for weeks because of my doubts..my mum understood me and was a great support. We are planning a holiday now to Asia to have a relaxing time and I'm slowly starting back to work again. I have no regrets fortunately, although I still feel guilt about breaking off a healthy pregnancy. I wish you mothers lot's of support, it really does get better, I see this with all my friends. And start working again, it's so important to have your own life, also for the kids! I also wrote this for all the women who are in doubt, please realize what you want before you become pregnant. I never thought I would become pregnant anymore but I did and to take that decision is heart breaking. I do blame myself for this."

protecttheinnocent,Wed 07-Mar-12 14:36:38,"I can really relate to this thread. I wanted children for a long time, lost a pregnancy in the 2nd tri and didn't get pregnant again for 2 years - I was nearly 40 by the time DS was born. Despite being so wanted, it was still a massive shock. I immediately regretted it and those feelings still haven't waned completely, although going back to work has greatly lessened them.I've felt all of the feelings mentioned on here over the last 2 years but I must say things are a lot better since my job improved - I've been back at work a year and am really into the swing of it again now. I still find DS very hard work though and am hopeless on the one day we have together and can't wait for bedtime - and feel guilty about that - horrendous!One thing I will say is that it has improved incrementally more and more as time has gone on. I suspect that this will only continue as he gets older.I'm also lucky enough to have 2 sets of very helpful grandparents. Without them, things would have been/would be a lot more difficult. We've managed to get away for weekends several times over the last couple of years and that has literally saved my life.What an excellent thread."

bacon,Wed 29-Aug-12 15:12:03,"Feeno - you must have some free time, time to have a hobby, some kind of escape?You must find some escape route because it is strangling and as a mild depressive but havent suffered badly for a while I can understand how it feels. Does anyone know how you feel?If your lucky to have family help then you must use it and find enjoyment in life again. If you have spare money then use a private nursery to have a break.I'm struggling too more than my OH knows, my children seem to have joy in constantly being horrible and wild. Everything I hated about other peoples children have now become mine!!!Feeno - your probably a better parent that youve given yrself credit for. I have done everything to the book, healthy pregnancy, routine, weaning to perfection, home cooked meals, social, etc but its a bit like spending time with a husband you want to divorce because you dislike him yet you are handcuffed to him forever!Seriously, if you are suffering so badly then you should get help to address these feelings have you tried CBT? You sound like you really need it. Many of us on this thread are depressed because of the children not depressed from outside issues and glad you address the effect it could have on your children."
leftfork,Wed 12-Sep-12 11:33:26,"Wonderful ladies,Been following this post for at least 18 months. You've made me feel less confused for which I thank you all. Similar story. DH wanted children, I didn't see the point, I had a great life. 4.5 years later here we are. I was right, I haven't had the light bulb moment and maybe I never will.Feeno,I remember being in a similar situation 2.5 years ago. Eldest child 21 months, 2nd child due, moving town at 37 weeks pregnant and completely depressed at the thought of child number 2. I didn't realise it then but I suffered from depression because I didn't want the kids but only talked to the GP recently - wish I had done it 2 years ago.As other ladies suggest do try and find some time for your self. You have a lot going on but just try and pick one thing. Maybe get Hubbie to take your child all day saturday (are there any Dad's group where you live?) while you do something you really miss doing, even if it's just reading Hello/newspaper the whole day.Anyway, I want to tell you it does get easier. By that I don't mean that you will suddenly love motherhood - I certainly don't but it's little things. My two keep each other company for 20-30 mins at a time now. I even found myself reading a book while with them yesterday ."
ophelia275,Fri 05-Oct-12 17:46:52,"WonderinAloud - I would strongly advise you NOT to have children shortly after moving. I moved a few months after my ds1 was born and I went into a pretty catastrophic depression (I was totally out of it, hallucinating and just feeling absolutely awful). I missed my family terribly and I found the two big changes - having a baby (which is a life change you cannot really ever be prepared for) and moving was just the worst mix. Unfortunately just after ds2 was born our landlord sold the flat we were living in and once again, I got very depressed having to make such a big move after such a big life change. In my experience it is too many big changes in one go and I would not advise it."
HavingAMaybe,Sun 07-Oct-12 01:42:39,"Have been following this thread for some time, and I am so grateful for everyone's honesty.I do not have children. Never thought I would. I am married to someone who never considered that he might not have kids one day. We discussed this at length both before and after getting married (and continue to now) but my feeling is that deep down he thinks I will change my mind.Occasionally I do think that maybe we should - he would be fabulous as a father and he understands most of my reasons for not wanting to.I had a mother who was depressed, unhappy, bitter etc. She has narc tendencies. My father just kept out of it for the most part and had many affairs. Eventually they split but not until I was in my late teens. I have anxiety and depressive episodes. I just know that having a child would be mentally extremely tough for me, despite DH knowing this. I don't think he really understands what it would be like and my fears about this.My friends who have (willingly! more or less) had children have been relatively honest with me as they know how I feel. They have had struggles and depression etc - almost all of them. And for the most part they weren't already dealing with mental health histories.I fear for my marriage ultimately. I love him, but I am not capable of being so selfless as to put myself through it all for him. I almost look forward to getting a bit older and finding that I am no longer able to have kids. Or I sometimes think that it may be a relief to find out that I can't. Which makes me feel like a very bad person obviously as there are people who would dearly love to be able to and can't. Anyway, that's me. Am very grateful for this thread."

canyoubelieveit,Tue 22-Jan-13 23:28:30,"I have a single mother to a one year old daughter who I had at the age of 35. All my life I thought I wanted children and I loved spending time with my friends children. I am so depressed at being a parent and I have absolutely no reason to be as my daughter is the sweetest, most lovable little girl who deserves the very best. I never thought in a million years I would feel like this honestly feel my life is over and I wish so much I could turn the clock back. I have explored anti depressants and therapy and none of it has helped. Has anyone ever thought things would be better for their child if they were adopted? Not that this could ever happen unless you were a teenage Mother. Having a child is a blessing, and it is so unnatural not to feel the greatest love for your child- I know I received it from my parents myself so I just don't understand how I could have got this so very wrong and I didn't know myself. I know it's utterly disgraceful and for most Mothers unbelievable but I really don't know what to do. Does anyone else feel this bad? I feel so guilty and sorry for my daughter but I desperately wish I could return to my old life. I find the practicalities and responsibilities of parenthood daunting and am like a Bridget Jones messy untidy childlike and it feels really tough rather than feeling you do whatever you can for your child I am not enjoying all the different stages which other parents understandably love. I have lost my confidence at work as I work 3 days a week so am out of the loop and I can't enjoy the days I have with my daughter- can't get things done, can't manage to look in anyway acceptably normal and groomed and be organised, tidy and practical. I'm also not at all interested in peppa pig etc. I honestly feel I am not cut out to look after another human being and it will get more demanding practically and financially as the years go on. I look around at all the Mothers I know and many of them have more children and a much more demanding life but they are motivated by the passion they feel towards their children. I really don't know what I can do to turn my thinking around and I've got to do it for the sake of my daughter. Does anyone have any advice? I just wish there was a way out of parenthood- can you believe it?"

BabooshkaBabooshka,Thu 13-Jun-13 08:50:21,"Shakey1500, my kids are young (5 and 2) and I have a little bit of support from my husband and mother (most of the grandparents live abroad). However, the support is mostly physical but they are also the ones who made me have another child, knowing how mentally ill I was so I don't really feel very supported by them. In all honesty, I don't think they really have a clue how I feel, even though I have spoken about it so much. I am just so so angry with myself, I can't get over it. I go over and over it in my mind and am just so constantly angry and the worst part is that I feel like these relatives don't really care about me that much because at the end of the day they put their desires (for another child/grandchild) before me and my wellbeing. It was obviously more important for my husband to have this child than for me to be well and happy. I have been sacrificed for his wants. It's not even like he is such a great dad and I wonder why we did all this when most of the time he seems so bored and frustrated with them. Recently the constant noise (high pitched screaming at 6am and constant fighting) has started to really get to me and I am starting to get very irritated by it and have started wearing earplugs all the time (which are not very comfortable).I just don't know what to do. I don't want to take pills as I am not ""depressed"" - i am just stuck in a situation i hate and regret. Sorry I sound like an absolute cow, I am not, my kids don't go without, but i am just dying inside."

Mine are older but one had SN and am struggling!!!! Dh rather in denial about SN needs, downplays it massively, our parents ditto. Overseas and zero SN support. Medication didn't help so trying to control thro diet but after 12+ years of oppositional behaviour ALL the time, EVERY conversation, feel so so weary and hopeless. Been dying inside most of our time here. My work refuge is gone. Oh what a pity party i am, sick of myself!!"
mouses,Sun 23-Jun-13 14:53:50,"reading this thread has lifted some heavy guilt off my shoulders, i do often tell my only firend that i regret having kids. i care about them and im protective of them, if they fall or get hurt - i hurt. so i know i love them. but if they wasnt here i wouldnt have to worry. if i was to say it in RL im sure to get a flaming and ungrateful speech!i had a horrid childhood amongst depressed unloving mum and no where around father. thought it would be clever to get pregnant at 18 and show my mother how to be a mum - how badly that back fired will always haunt me! had second DS cos i didnt want my child to be lonely. when he was born i felt nothing, he wasnt for me he was for my son. i suffered PND and didnt bond with him until he was 1.5yrs old. what made it worse was the useless man who they called dad got to keep his drink and drug lifestyle while i was at home thinking how to end it all. so when i met some one new it felt fresh and with rose tinted glasses and promises of support i had DD..... it was like those years all over again! like round 2! i had no support, no family support from his just as before with ex dp. once again man carries on his luxury life while i hide away deep with depression.fast forward 3yrs and im ruined! a complete mess. man lives with his mum, no support from either dad or family. poor kids who didnt ask to be here are stuck with a depressed mother and dull life that reflects my own. in a way i wish i never had them for their own sanity aswell as mine.if i could rewind time then i can honestly say i wouldnt have kids."

MillionPramMiles,Sat 16-Nov-13 11:09:17,"Been a while since I posted on this thread, I find myself coming back to it for encouragement when I'm feeling particularly miserable. Lots of posts have struck a cord. Thanks to the poster who pointed out that being utterly miserable for a reason isn't the same as depression. I don't think I'm depressed but dp seems to want to attach that label to me. I guess it's easier than accepting that I regret giving in and having a child, that its made me very unhappy, that its destroyed a relationship that meant everything to me but that I'm just trying to get on with it. I recently posted elsewhere about feeling dp and i needed time away from dd and that we had only had 4 days away from dd this year. Lots of people posted that 4 days was a lot and that they hadn't left their child for years. That thread made me feel like an outcast. This one doesn't. Thanks for that. Ps hope Zahora and others are ok."
fullfathomfive,Sun 17-Nov-13 12:13:34,"To all the brave and brilliant women on this thread who have wrestled with a similar dilemma: I'd appreciate it a lot if you could read to the end. I don't know what I'm doing and I'm in a state of complete despair.I am seven weeks pg, but very ambivalent towards the pg. I know that to have a baby, you should really want one. And I'm not sure how much I do. I am forty and have no other children, so at this point I think I have to accept that I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't. It's going to be difficult either way; with either course of action, there will be hardships and loss and regrets. But this still doesn't help me to know what to do.My situation is complicated by the fact that I am 40; dp is almost 60. But hey! at least I have a dp, right? Lots of people go it alone at this age.... the other factor that doesn't help is that there are no aunts / cousins / grandparents / brothers / sisters, etc in our town, so we'd be dealing with all childcare on our own. My family are miles away. His family are grown / scattered / dead, etc.I love playing with babies and small children, and I have a nephew who I adore. But I've never spent more than 48 hours in sole charge of a tot. THe idea of it fills me equally with feelings of excitement and horror. Now that I am pg, I constantly try to imagine myself doing the things I normally do, only while being in sole charge of a two-year-old. This rules out: taking a long bath; going running; lying here on Sunday morning typing this; browsing shops; taking a long time to cook something new; staying late at work because I feel like getting a bit extra done; basically, the extent to which it changes your life makes my head spin. It is intimidating me. How do you all manage?!I keep thinking to myself: you are 40. You've managed this far, without children. You haven't particularly craved them. You are doing okay now (after many and various difficulties, especially in my 20s). But then I think: if you terminate, you will regret it because this is your last chance.Although my desire to have kids has always been ""Oh, it'll be nice if it happens"", rather than ""Got To Do It At All Costs!!"". Now it is happening and if I'm completely honest, I can't say I'm over the moon. My initial reaction when I saw the faint line was, ""Oh. S**t.""  I thought, ""perhaps I'll miscarry, then the decision will take care of itself"", but I don't think this is going to happen, somehow. I'm an idiot and I don't know what to do. I have printed this entire thread and read it lots of times. The bits that resonate are MelaniefhappyAND work! By this I mean it will be ME doing the packed lunches, book bags, getting kids up, ironing outfits, driving to school, and all other admin as necessary- all before work then it will be (you guessed it) ...ME picking up kids - oh an 18 hour day YIPPIE!!!wantmyflattummybackI do love DS and absolutely want the best for him - it hurts when he is upset. BUT - I still feel it would have been better for all concerned if he had never existed.Of course, it's highly unfortunate to look back, with hindsight, and think ""if I could live again, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have children"". And I would like to avoid this, of course. But then you have mothers saying ""it was the making of me"", ""the most intense love affair ever"", ""the best thing I ever did"". But I have no clue which way it will go for me. All I know is that I am full of trepidation. I am browsing the thread reminding myself of posts that resonate, but there are just too many, and it's so upsetting that I'm now crying.fortyandstillunsure, canyoubelieveit and lastminute all speak very loudly to me.But I just don't know if I can terminate. When I look at new mums with their babies, I feel jealous! But I don't feel at all jealous of older mums in their fifties struggling with hormonal teenagers, and knackered sixty-year-olds working difficult jobs to put demanding kids through university. And the baby bit is oh-so-transient. Perhaps I should focus on being a brilliant auntie to my three neices and nephews, and a good partner and loving daughter to my brilliant mum (who I haven't always had the best relationship with, but I do now).I'm scared of the commitment, and scared of living out the rest of my years feeling as though I've missed something wonderful and as though I lack a sense of purpose. Plus, I would always be looking over my shoulder at that time when I was 40, thinking ""what if...?"". To be honest, though, I don't think an abortion would ruin my life. I had one at 35 and didn't regret it or think about it much. In the back of my mind I was thinking ""there can be another time"". But this time, there can't. I need to take control, make a decision, and enjoy the rest of my life. Yet this is easier said than done. In some ways, getting pg at 40 is like a gift. I have had not a jot of sickness. So why am I so unsure what to do for the best.Then there is the small matter of money: neither me nor dp have much money. He is retired and has a pension of £1,000 a month. I'd be on maternity. Not much to sustain three of us! I should have known my own mind before getting pg. There is a counselling service for women in our position called 'ticktockcounselling' but I didn't know until I was pg. I agree with all of you who cite social pressures: threads like this are like 24 carot gold. Elsewhere, all you hear about are the supposed delights and joys.What a mess. "

DavetheCat2001,Mon 03-Feb-14 19:09:30,"I sometimes find myself wishing the time away as I find looking after small children so desperately boring.I have a DS who is 3 and a DD who is 6 months, and whilst I love them dearly, the 3 year old knows exactly how to push my buttons and I spend an awful lot of time telling him off and occasionally shouting at him, which always makes me feel sad and depressed.Some days I am so tired I just want to slump on the sofa, but you can't with a 3 year old who is bouncing off the walls and a baby who requires regular feeding (I'm BF'ing).I drag myself to the park and stand around freezing, windy playgrounds and wonder if this is all there is to life. What I'd really love to do is drop them off with a grandparent for a weekend and go off with OH and have some fun..I can't remember the last time we did anything or went anywhere that didn't involve kids. Unfortunately my parents are in their mid 70's and in poor health so can't help, and OH's parents live over 3 hours away, so we have no family support. I am so envious of friends who have younger, fitter and closer parents to take their kids off to the park or away for weekends.None of my close friends have ids ether..it seems to have skipped my generation of friends a bit (I'm 40), so I perceive them as all still having loads of freedom and going out having fun etc, and I can't..selfish I know.Anyway..thanks for this thread. It's very comforting to know that being an 'earth mother' isn't for everyone!I wonder too how Baboushka and the original OP are doing now...?"
Madcat22,Fri 14-Feb-14 13:59:56,"I've got a six week old baby girl who I love terribly. However, having had PND after the birth of my DS three years ago, I am now starting to develop similar symptoms which is terrifying because it was awful last time. I was on Citalopram last time which helped but it was when my son was older than my little one so it wasn't a problem to give up BF. BF is going really well this time and I really don't want to stop but absolutely won't take any AD and BF at the same time. Feeling very lonely and isolated with no one to talk to so thought I'd post my very first ever message on MN to see if anyone had any other tips about coping with PND without AD. I'm starting CBT in 10 days time but really want someone to talk to or some informal help too so I don't feel so alone. Please help!! My babies deserve more than a depressed mummy."
Bollydarling,Wed 14-May-14 00:36:37,"Thanks. I can really relate to a lot of what been said and realise that I am not depressed, just not happy with my current situation.It really is taboo to say anything negative about having children. If I am slightly down with one 'friend' who has spent the deposit for a house on IVF, I am immediately reminded of how lucky I am. Yet I have to keep stum when she says how much she needs her week long yoga retreat in Turkey. I have had a friend reshuffle since having kids. I think for those of you considering kids I would sayIf you are getting on a bit (I was 40 when DS was born and 42 when DD was born) and in any way ambivalent then don't do it. Try and ignore the pressure or deal with it outright, take the steps to ensure you don't stay in a relationship when DP/DH changes his mind about kids, find something else meaningful to fill your time etc. I'm not sure that I regret that I had kids but if I had my time again things would be different. If you do go ahead make sure you have done your maths. Full time child care for one child can be covered by a £20k salary with a bit to spare. It costs over £2k a month for two.... And when you have moved to the sticks for a better quality of life, £35k jobs in the charitable sector are hard to come by. I didn't plan to have kids so didn't plan my career. DH earns enough for us to live on but there's nothing to spare. Two kids also seem to be sooooo much more difficult than one so if you are in any way ambivalent about the second don't do it. Having said that my 9 month old DD is gorgeous with a sunny nature (she didn't get that from me) and seems to be an easier baby than her brother. But I am sure when he is 4 and she is 2 he will be the easier child.Don't have preconceptions about how you will parent or let anyone tell you what to do. Have confidence in your gut instincts. Breast feeding past 6 months, baby wearing, bed sharing etc have helped me bond with children whom I think I love but have no overwhelming feelings for. For other people bottles, schedules and sleep training work as they enable them to return to work and have a break. It is very difficult when grandparents are too old/far away to be actively involved, and the local mums I have bonded with are those that work or who will be going back to work shortly so limited opportunities for helping out with child care to give each other a break. It feels selfish to walk out the door for run as DH walks after a 12 hour day but if it means I have more patience then it isn't selfish. I personally have used baby and toddler groups as a chance for break as sometimes someone will hold the baby and the toddler can play independently, it just depends on how he is feeling. Often someone will make me a cup of coffee as wellGood luck to us all. This thread has made me realise, once again, that things are not so bad for me"
HoneyBadger80,Wed 28-May-14 20:27:56,"Its funny how you never love your children so much as when they are sleeping! I mean I love my DS, don't get me wrong, I have always loved him in a dutiful functional kind of way, but I have never enjoyed being a parent until recently, and even now occasionally its really tiresome... Known affectionately to me (or not) as 'being under house arrest', it was horrid being a SAHM- just mind numbingly boring and endlessly tiring, like an 18hr job with no pay and no one to talk to, then in the other 6 hours you get to do further housework etc and maybe squeeze a bit of a snooze in here and there.When you're a single mom, you might as well be in solitary confinement, but its even worse because you add total sleep deprivation, slave labor and mental torture that you cant share with a significant other...it comes to something when you have seen all the episodes of peppa pig (my favorite being the one where they go ice skating) and the thing you look forward to is an episode you haven't seen, and that you have managed to learn basic sign language courtesy of Mr Tumble.I was never maternal, people even used to comment how odd it looked if i held a friends baby (normally at arms length hoping it wouldn't puke), i have no idea why I decided to have a baby- it seemed like the right time I suppose, financially stable, engaged (although he left not long after DS was born) blah blah blah. Turns out I'm a crap mom, not in the basic needs sense, but in the actually liking children sense. I mean if it were Neanderthal times then I'd be the most awesome mom ever- like if it were about survival of the fittest then my offspring would be chubby feral survivors.... but its not. Its a day and age where even the mere sniff of not being totally grateful and in love with motherhood gets you shot down by the mummy mafia. Those who chirp on about how fulfilling and meaningful having children is and who do arts and crafts 8 hours a day, and bake cakes with perfect princess daughters like something off a bloody flora advert.I had post natal depression, which sucked, I dont think i really loved DS with affection until he was about 6 months old thanks to that, but i was a good mom in the functional sense (keeping things clean, keeping DS fed and watered, changed and comfortable and happily dribbling at the tweenies) for the first 18 months, it didn't get really bad until the 'terrible 2,3 and 4's kicked in, along with speech, potty training, breaking things, tantrums and the words 'no' and 'why'. In hindsight i think i got off pretty easy as my DS was a pretty good child looking back and having experience now of other peoples kids who are far more 'naughty' than my DS was, or friends with kids who have disabilities requiring constant care... but at the time, being an exhausted single mom with no support network and no outside contact from grown ups other than my parents or family maybe once or twice a week, i used to think about walking out all the time and leaving DS with his dad or with my parents....I mean men just take off all the time without much recrimination, so why couldn't I?NO IDEA...god i wanted to....I wanted to SO badly. I used to fantasize about running away and working in bars in greece or on cruise ships etc all the time, but there was just something that stopped me, I don't know if it was some deeper primal in-build mother love/instinct or just plain society based expectation and guilt. I used to get to the point of packing my bags then I'd have a flash forward into how much I could screw him up emotionally. See his little face understanding that his mom didn't love him. To think I hadn't loved him enough to stay, to think he wasn't worth the effort, to think he could live his life feeling like he wasn't worthy and where those feeling of self loathing/guilt/worthlessness might take him. The kind of life he could end up living if I weren't there to keep fighting for better for him(cue tears and floods of guilt). Bloody awful times they were. It was just a cycle of misery- frustration- resentment and guilt.It started getting easier when he turned about 5 and started to understand the world a bit better, and being more independent....I think it also helped that I started working full time about the same time. He's 8 now, and I can say now that he's brilliant 90% of the time- he's my little mate and has a great personality and I love him to bits, I miss him now a little bit when he goes to his dads or grandparents, which is a relatively new experience as I've always enjoyed and craved my child-free time and as long as his safety was assured I'd go and have a 'single and childfree' 48 hours once every 2 weeks- where I could pretend I had my life as it was pre-DS and go back to real life on a sunday evening.Having been just me and him for so long now, I cant imagine my life without him (wait that's not true- I imagine my life without him fondly and wistfully for 5 seconds, then realize there's only so much clubbing in Day-Glo bikinis a woman can do at the age of 34 LOL). Its a pain in the bum all the rushing about and organizing and planning that you do when you are trying to 'enrich' your child's life, all the driving to cubs/football/cricket/parties/swimming lessons/karate/play dates...god it just goes on and on and never ends, kind of like the laundry pile created by afore mentioned extra curricular activities. I am convinced I could personally captain an elite squad of Navy seals with my military timing and planning precision.When i look back i feel massively ashamed and guilty about all the times i resented him and the life i chose in having him, yes it was hard, yes it was tiring and thankless and exhausting and at times soul destroying. Yes I felt like I had lost who I was, and that the only thing that defined me was being a mom, that I had given up my life for 18 years. But truth be told I was selfish and immature and not particularly nice before I had him- I realize that now. He has taught me to be truly selfless, to make sacrifices when I REALLY don't want to, to think always of someone else's future beyond my own and having him has in general made me a more patient, organized and independent person than I would ever have thought possible. I still wear my 'bad mom' t-shirt every now and again (metaphoric of course) and scream and shout at him over small things that needn't be screamed about...and he knows to give me a wide berth on those days... but when I see the kind, sensitive, helpful, mostly polite and thoughtful boy that he is becoming already, I have hope that despite everything, despite all the negative thoughts and misery and despair i felt in the early years, and all the crying in the shower, and all the wishing I'd never had him, that he is, against the odds, going to turn out to be a lovely young man....and it absolves me a little of the guilt. That if our children are reflections of us as parents, I cant be such a truly awful terrible incapable mother. TBF I think I got away really lightly with him- cos he's more of a moaner than a rebel, and aside from ongoing (grrr) annoying nightly negotiations about why he has to go to bed at 8.30, he's pretty low maintenance.I never thought i'd find myself saying i wouldn't change having him...up until the last couple of years i was still saying i regretted ever having kids...in fact i could have been voted the person most likely to build a time machine and go back and change everything so I could carry on clubbing in furry boots and run away with the circus... but now the hardest times have passed, I wouldn't change him. ....still there's the 10% of the time when I cant wait for him to grow up and sod off lol.Hugs to everyone feeling crappy...all I can say is hopefully it will get easier for you like it has for me. And don't feel guilty if you aren't mary poppins- the mummy mafia will manage with one less member. xxxxxx"

It's fucking awful. I don't know why I had mine I really don't. Yeah sure I love them, I do every thing for them, but I regret having them. I don't want this life. I want to live, I want adventure, I want something more. I'm selfish. I wish I could be brave enough to give them to their dad's and go, but I can't. At least 16 more years of this.This is an awful post but it feels good to let it out.I don't know why I did this to myself, or to them really. The guilt is tremendous."
diannside,Wed 01-Oct-14 09:03:10," my mother regretted me and left me homeless at age 13. I knew it didn't matter how well I acted and that it wasn't my fault that she was so abusive, but it still hurt. I discovered music festivals as a result. I soon began selling my artwork at them, touring all over the country. the farther away from my abusive mother I was, the better I felt. from 15 to 28 years old, it was always the same life-long art goals- to finish new masterpieces and then sell them at the shows. I gained recognition around the country while still a teenager and thought I was on my way... but then I was approached by a guy that seemed to care a lot about me. I was very busy and wasn't even lookn for a boyfriend but I fell for his charms. I was dumb because he turned out to be an abuser. I told him that I didn't want children but he kept pushing me to have unprotected sex. he beat me while I was pregnant. to make along story short, my art dreams have been replaced with single motherhood, and i'm dying inside. no time for the kind of art I do. I used to lock myself in a room for weeks literally. I do love my son and I try to block out the pain of being severed from my livelihood but it always resurfaces again and again. I've always used my art to heal and I'm unable to get my therapy. I feel like instead of being that well known and respected artist, instead i'm on my way to becoming my worst nightmare- my mother. worst part is that I've ended up moving to my mother's home town for more support. unfortunately her alcoholism makes her distant and it's just me and my son on our own now in iowa. iowa a place I never would have saw myself 5 years ago from Colorado where I used to live. I am afraid for my son because if he grows up seeing me so miserable, well that's not good for him either. sad to say that I actually felt freer in jail. i'm sorry but it's true. I try to deny these feelings and I just feel like I don't have a soul anymore and even have suicidal thoughts. so far my son is a happy and vibrant 2 year old but i'm worried that my deep sorrow could destroy both of our lives. I feel like i'm being swallowed and can never breath. can't be good. god please help. i'm not ok"

Sirraleigh,Fri 05-Dec-14 20:45:15,"Hi everyone & AmonRa1,I read your post and like blackeyedsally said, I think you should not have children.Having kids is as terrible as you describe it. I am a caring father of a four year old son and I regret having him every day. There's really hardly anything I enjoy about being a parent. You will be sleep-deprived all the time, you will end up a zombie most of the time just dragging yourself from one mind numbing activity to the next. With an annoying whining kid that will demand attention. You will be wishing to be doing other things all the time, but your ""me-time"" will be reduced to almost nothing.And all that is not even the worst bit. The worst thing is being stuck! I mean, you cant leave your partner and kid, because you know they'll suffer even more... So, the only option you'll have is to accept that you'll be miserable for years to come... Someone once wrote: ""most men lead lives of quiet desperation""... I know now that that is what being a parent is truly about.And i think i'm kind of lucky. My wife is hot and we have great sex, i have a wonderful job, great friends and grandparents that help out, but the moment i get home and need to be a parent... I turn into a depressed zombie...I wish i'd known what being a parent was really like 4 years ago. I would have never ever ever EVER have had a child.Ramble over...Take care everyone."
Shakey1500,Mon 02-Feb-15 19:58:25,"Bingesplodge and TheLondonerHello lovelies. I'm the poster who had the thunderbolt moment when DS was aged 4. I'll reiterate, I've never felt such relief over anything in my life and literally sank to my knees and wailed like a banshee.What's good is that you both have support from close family members/partner that are able to least share the load. I recall DH being away from home for 2 weeks and I was struggling massively, totally overwhelmed. Clock watching until bedtime till I could at least breathe on my own (and smoke copiously). My parents came one afternoon and whilst I thought I was plastering the right kind of smile on my face they must have seen right through me and offered to take DS overnight. The relief!DS is 8 this year and in all honesty, I know it seems like a distant lifetime away but time really has flown. I do still have pangs of yearning for my ""old"" life but it seems so far back that this life has morphed into me accepting that this is my life (if that makes sense) and I'll admit I sometimes often fantasise about retirement when I'll be totally able to do exactly as I please.TheLondoner You are right, it will come. And do you know why I think it will? Because I truly believe that if none of us really cared, we wouldn't bother to find threads like these to seek help, words of comfort, knowledge we're not alone. It's bloody hard, especially in the early years. I just had no option but to muddle through the fug, take each day/week/month at a time and wait for it to pass. There was no lead up to the thunderbolt, it just happened. Perhaps because I (thought I'd) reconciled myself to the fact I would always feel as despairing as I did. I wasn't trying, wasn't looking for it, I just ploughed through. But I'm mighty grateful it did and a huge burden has lifted. Keep ploughing, keep doing the best you can, even if you feel it's not enough, it is enough for now. We're none of us perfect, there are no guidelines, our emotions can overtake us sometimes, we will get there in our own time, in our own way. Because we're human. And it's totally ok to feel absolutely rotten about it and yearn backwards. As I often say, it's not wrong it's just...different. And for those that slate this thread and have no understanding, I don't feel anger towards them, I feel glad that they have not felt like I and many of us did. Because I wouldn't wish it on any parent. Glad you found this thread. I always have it on watch and always try to reply  Even if you don't feel like it, you're doing great."

Please remember this thread is written by parents who are struggling, and that is not necessarily the only thing they (we) think and feel. I was very depressed when pregnant and got excellent counselling through the hospital, which also lasted 2 years after my dc was born. If you haven't already, please talk to your midwife about getting some support."
lifeinruins,Sat 05-Sep-15 03:52:27,"I need to put this ""out there"". Unlike many people on this thread, I am not technically a SAHM. I am currently studying at university, doing an honours level degree part time. This is for a career change. It's tough and I must have top marks in order to proceed further.I used to have a career in IT. I had a 6-figure salary. I knew for many years that it wasn't for me, that I didn't enjoy it, and so I started studying part time - slowly preparing to step out. I had a small but beautiful Victorian-era house. I could afford my own mortgage, my own lifestyle. I do have a history of anxiety and depression though, but I learned to manage it.I married my best friend, whom I love dearly. I always thought that I had to have a child - my biological clock was saying so, my family was saying so - it was just ""one of those things"", even though I am not maternal and don't like children - but I was convinced (primarily by my mother) that it wouldn't matter because it is different with one's own child.I got pregnant on the night we got engaged. My husband wanted the child - me: well, the timing was horrid (I just changed, jobs, was in 3rd year of my degree, we were planning a wedding and honeymoon and to just enjoy being a couple)... but I wasn't going to have an abortion. So - we had a beautiful baby girl. Because there was no way I could have enough time and energy to hold a fulltime job and study successfully enough to be able to achieve the level I needed, it was decided that I would leave my job and IT and concentrate on the studies and motherhood. My husband makes a very good salary, and we could afford it. What we could not afford was a larger place, so we all moved into my small house. It became very crowded, the decor haphazard, but it had to happen (partly of me - I refused to move out of my home when I found out I was pregnant. I am very home bound, and, by then, with my biological instinct having calmed down, I already realised what a horrible mistake I made. That I didn't want a child at all. That I treasured my life as it was. But it was too late.)My daughter is 18 months now. She goes to a good child care place 4 days a week. She gets sick with minor colds a lot, which she has to stay home for quite often, but we have support from both grandmothers. I get to study - something I enjoy a lot.And, still, I am MISERABLE! I love my daughter, I am a very good mother. I don't lose it with her, I am practicing respectful parenting, I keep my depression at bay most of the time, when I am around her.... and I HATE MY LIFE.I pop 10 pills a day to keep the depression at bay. I've seen a psychologist but there's nothing really that can be done because I am not being delusional - my life has changed in exact ways I see, with some good things (you know, those moments of connection with the child, watching her grow, etc etc), but many of the changes I hate and, overall, the good does not in any way, shape or form make up for the bad. I can't lie to myself, I can't forget about it, I can't ignore it. I used to be a beautiful energetic person, who took a lot of pride in her appearance, was VERY fit, and was sexual. I am too tired now - I don't have energy/time/or am sick with the latest virus my daughter brought into the house, which saps energy even more. I have not enjoyed sex since the day my daughter was born. I participate in it for my husband's sake. I live in jeans and jumpers - those that I don't care whether they get stained or not. I don't even remember what is in my closets, let alone remember how to dress up (and, oh boy, did I used to - I used to favour gothic clothing and make up).My house I already mentioned - there are things constantly in need of fixing, cleaning, it's got plastic boxes and computer things everywhere, because we have no where to put them - and no energy to really sort things out and throw things out. My beautiful house is no longer a place of pride and joy for me - it's still my home though.Because I have left my career, and because of where I was in my career at the time I left (transitioning from a programmer to a project manager, but not having yet enough time in the manager's role to be able to get job as one, and, now being out too long from a position of a programmer - 5 years away from cutting-edge stuff is a VERY LONG TIME in this industry), I don't think I could possibly get a job which will allow me to support myself... and this is something I always was able to do. I am holding onto my studies, but I am so, so exhausted. I am not sure I can keep that up and it's still 4 years before I can actually start working in the new field.My husband is exhausted too - he always understood me, understood my mental health issues, was always supportive, but he is feeling hopeless. There's nothing he can do (any more than he already can, given that he has to hold down the job to pay for us all). We've all been living with the idea that ""it's going to get better"" - but, 18 months later - it isn't. Every time I have to spend more than 1 hour on my own with my daughter I end up looking at the clock every 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes counting down to when someone else can take over. I always have to push the thought away of ""I'd rather be elsewhere, do something else"". Lately, that something else has been ""sleep"". I just want to sleep. It's depression and I am tired of fighting it, and I have assignments due, so I can't just sleep the days away.We've started talking about my husband and daughter moving out to his mother's. He doesn't want to. His mother, of course, wouldn't want him to. I don't want him to. But I don't want to be paying this price. I don't want to be a shadow of myself. I want my life back, so much (even though I know I can't have it back - because I want a life with my husband, whom I love... but without my daughter!!!!) I love her too, very much... but I love myself more! And it's selfish and horrid, but I do!I do."

Viewofhedges,Mon 22-Feb-16 16:24:42,Hello Cornwall. There haven't been many posters on here for a while but I've seen your messages and wanted to reach out with a hug. We're in very different positions - I was due to start IVF in January but after crying snottily down the phone at the nurse we panicked and pulled out. I'm now back on the thinking about it and feeling every day slip past (I'm 39 now) and not knowing if we're having a lucky escape or missing out on something amazing. I don't know if I'll ever know.For what it's worth I think you're in a very difficult situation and I'm not surprised you're struggling. I can't begin to imagine how hard twins must be and how hard it must be to have a partner who doesn't want kids. (My DH and I are similarly torn which means it's hard to decide but at least we're as hopeless as each other). It's a real shame that your DH can't step up and interact with his own family. Great that you can afford a Nanny though and I hope you can use that resource to give yourself some time to rest and breathe. I hope you can find some support in IRL. Are there any twins support networks you can join? My friend had twins and a toddler and I'm surprised she didn't collapse (I went to help her a few times but when she told me to 'just get a dog' when we couldn't have kids and were trying to figure that out in our minds we stopped talking. But now both DH and I really want a dog!) I really do send you as much support as possible over the internet and hope that as they grow you will experience some of the joy that's supposed to come with kids.
Simmi1,Tue 23-Feb-16 23:26:56," I remember wanting to run away when dd1 was a baby as I was tired and overwhelmed. However things did get easier when she started sleeping through at 6 months and then I went back to work at 9 months. Then I got pregnant again, and was happy to be expecting. Had dd2 6 months ago and have been experiencing severe IBS symptoms ever since which has really made me regret having her. I now have 2 small children and I feel unwell. Never had any of theses problems before birth and no one seems to know what's causing it and how to fix it. I feel miserable and depressed and want my old life back when dd1 was in nursery and I was working and most importantly was healthy. This has made me feel suicidal."
lazyminimoo,Sat 23-Apr-16 02:41:52, Yes i have really regretted having my son as i have depression social anxiety an i feel like he shouldn't have to have me for a mum an i feel like i would be less depressed if i didn't have to worry about how I'm affecting him and how hes gong to grow up feeling regretful and sad that he has a mum like me . Its just guilt that i wouldn't have to have if i didn't have a child. I don't want him gone but i at times feel it would have been best all round if i hadn't had him or if only id have had him adopted so his life would turn out better and i wouldn't feel so bad and worry all the time about how I'm not being a good mum an he deserves much better . I have mostly thought yes in a heartbeat i would go back In time an have the abortion I was planning to have but didn't because the dad begged me not to an i didn't wanna lose him as he would have dumped me if i had aborted . I sometimes think maybe i was selfish not aborting him as he now has a life that i feel is worse then most 3 year olds lives because they have nice normal mum's not socially anxious depressive mums .
diamond457,Mon 25-Jul-16 18:51:46,"I constantly grieve over my old life and all the potential I had and the things I could have done with my life. I had dd at 19 so its my own fault. But I am depressed and my career is well and truly down the pan. Applying for jobs I wouldn't have took in a million years because its all I can do now due to childcare restrictions etc.I do feel like a caged animal, a shell of who I was.but I do love dd and im a good mum and she deserves the best.I have to live with the grief the rest of my life."
dranaksjd,Thu 25-Aug-16 11:19:56, I regret having my son. If I could I back I would. I'm not depressed. I'm just not cut out to be surrounded by a child for years of my life and all the limitations that entails.

Sirraleigh,Tue 21-Feb-17 16:19:03,"I was happy. What I wasn't happy with, I changed. There's a lot you can change in life. Being a parent, when it makes you depressed and hate yourself, is not easy to change.Any advice is appreciated. How did you deal with, cope with that regret???"
AnxiousCarer,Tue 21-Feb-17 17:43:09," Hi, it sounds like things are tough at the moment. I know how stressful I find it when DH has been out of work and We've been in the same sort of financial situation as you. As everything is feeling hard I wonder if a trip to the GP is in order. You could be depressed as a culmination of all the stress. Do you do anything judt for you? I find that really important for my MH. I find exercise and meditation and mindfulness helpful. I always seem to have a better day when I meditate before work for 10 mins. I used an app called headspace initially which was useful. I tend to do it on the bus on the way to work."
rightsofwomen,Mon 24-Oct-16 10:55:28," I just don't like being on them. I don't know if I ever really was clinically depressed, but started taking them as I didn't want to look like I was refusing the help the GP was offering me."
FuckingHellz,Thu 15-Dec-16 21:52:06,"Please take this advice - reduce your dose by 2.5mg every month. You won't get any withdrawal effects, brain zaps or feel you are getting depressed again. It can take a few months but I've done it twice now successfully A long time ago a go told me to alternate doses ie 10 mg one day then 20mg the next. I was fucked and went back on the original dose as I thought I was getting depressed again.You can do it, just be sure in your mind that you're ready to come off them x"
BingBongBam,Thu 15-Dec-16 22:24:56,"Yes, be sure you are ready to come off them, I thought I was and five weeks later I'm depressed again having been feeling great until the last couple of days, though maybe that's down to work stress and friendship changes."
WindfallenArch,Tue 04-Oct-16 13:36:50," Everything really is as bad as I think it is - I don't think it's catastrophic thinking - I really am unemployable, friendless and skint. I see no end to it. I'm simultaneously skilless and overqualified so have no idea what to do to get some work to at least have a reason to get out of bed and wash. My family are all dead, my children have recently reached the stage where I embarrass them - they were my world and gave me a reason to live. My marriage is an empty shell. I have nothing and no one. I therefore wonder if there is anything wrong with my mental health at all - I may just be perfectly reasonably hopeless."
OhNoNotMyBaby,Tue 04-Oct-16 13:43:43, Please go and see your doctor. I'm no expert but you seem very depressed to me. You are a wife and a mother and an individual with unique skills and talents. You are not worthless - you've just forgotten and misplaced your confidence and self-esteem. Get some medical help and then you can start working your way back to becoming the real you again.
Allatseainthemidlands,Tue 04-Oct-16 13:50:53,"I know nothing about mental health but if you need a reason to get out of bed and wash/ make yourself employable have you considered volunteering? You can do all sorts of amazing stuff as a volunteer and meet new people/make new friends in the process. Does your OH feel the same way about your marriage? Could it be retrieved? Is it worth talking about or seeking counselling? And as for your children- this is just a stage- they will get past it - maybe not for several years but they will. They will need you to help them negotiate the early adult years- uni, parenthood etc. It's easy to make your world all about them but you had a world before they came along and you are a whole person whether or not they think so. Please don't despair- and do consider seeing your GP about your sense of sadness and loss. Good luck"
WindfallenArch,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:25:30," natsku I don't rule it out, but I guess the reason I am posting here is that I really do think that there is nothing wrong with my brain chemistry. So much awful stuff has happened and having spent months unemployed and being rejected over and over again and seeing no end in sight, I am, it would seem justifiably hopeless rather than clinically depressed. I have nothing and I've lost hope. That's not an illness - it's a reaction. "
useryourillusion,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:27:49,"I'm so, so sorry you are going through this. Your despair screams from every line and I really do feel for you and the agony you are going through.I can totally relate to your situation and can truthfully say there is hope for you. It seems as if you are an intelligent, self-aware person - while this very attributes can give you painful insights, they are also potential springboards to happiness, fulfilness and achievement.The raw materials are there, is is just a process to use them positively.Posting here and expressing yourself is a real breakthrough.Well can I hear the sadness, the paralysing feelings you are having, but please, please try to start with a little self-care... maybe something as small as washing your face? I can't fully explain why but once you put even a little time into yourself, this positivity grows and helps you to help yourself.Sorry if this is rambling, but please keep going, you are made of stars xx"
Dontyouopenthattrapdoor,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:34:56,"Windfallen if you try antidepressants and you're right, you're not depressed, you can just come off them again.If however this IS partly a depression, they may lift the corners just enough for you to see a way forward.Worth a try, I'd say.Get some easy snacks in. Cereal bars, porridge, cheese and crackers, smoothies? Stuff you can easily nourish yourself with. If you're running on empty physically you will also run on empty emotionally and mentally."
whycantwegoonasthree,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:45:02,"I think circumstances can be so shit and that a perfectly natural reaction to that is to feel depressed. ie. You may be quite right that it's a natural reaction to a catalogue of shit. But it is still a reaction that you can get help with. And meds can help, they really can, as well as a proper amount of talking therapies. (Possibly a different one though - the one you described sounds like - well, at the very least not the right fit for you.)It doesn't meant that there's anything inherently wrong with you - in that any or all of us may have felt the same as you after what you've been through. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek help to cope with everything that's happened.That's also a perfectly natural thing to do.It's not your fault. And you may not be able to do anything about the circumstances but you can seek help to address your feelings and reactions to the circumstances.It doesn't mean you're 'faulty'. It just means you've had too much to cope with and rightly need some help.Good luck.x"
WindfallenArch,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:45:03,Kasparprinceofthieved I'm sorry to hear you feel sad too. I hope you feel better soon. I really don't think I've ever known what people mean when they say they feel 'joy'. Sometimes I don't feel despair. That's the best I ever feel.
Purplebluebird,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:58:55,"Oh you sound very depressed  I think your therapist must have been rubbish, they should not make you feel worse - they should give you tools to cope when things are bad. Go back to your GP, ask for ADs (seriously, they can help) and therapy with someone else, because you didn't get along with the previous one.I understand it's difficult with the job situation at the moment - perhaps you could find the energy to start a hobby? You would not get rejected in a hobby club "

Actually suicidal. I am scared to go there again for something that I couldn't perceive was later doing any good. I feel like it would all be ok if I had a purpose and somebody, somewhere liked me.

QuiteLikely5,Tue 04-Oct-16 19:28:48,Op the only way from here is up. If nothing changes then nothing changes. Try some vit D to make sure you are good in that dept. Your past is in the past and you cannot alter that. You do not need to let it define your future. A sad person would not be displaying the sort of behaviour that you are so I think that you may be medically depressed. Call the GP and let him decide. The horror of MH problems is that often it's only our inner self who can bring ourselves out of the situation and it takes effort to realise that. And without medication it really does boil down to mind over matter. Why not go back to college to retrain in a new career? Evening classes perhaps? A confidence building course?
Bibbidee,Wed 05-Oct-16 06:59:23,"I felt suicidal last week and I'd lost a stone in weight but I'm sure the AD's are kicking in now and I see a glimmer of hope. So what if you didn't do this and that in your life. Maybe you're a late starter? You're not too old to make a teeny weeny change? I'm taking anxiety meds, AD's and Diazapam and this is getting me through the worst of my life right now. I don't intend to stay on them all but I consider them my arm bands, keeping me afloat until I can learn to swim again. You can do anything you want to do you just need to find the strength to get up some how. Good luck to you, bless ya xxx"
junebirthdaygirl,Wed 05-Oct-16 09:10:10,Is there an organisation called Grow in your area? They are very good at helping people get on their feet again. I would leave looking for a job at the moment as you won't have the energy for it yet. Go to the doctor and spill it out. A lot of depression is reactivate. They are used to that. Also you say you're children are embarrassed by you. That's pretty regular at a certain stage but it ends and they return to normal so don't despair on that. It will pass.
Babblehag,Wed 05-Oct-16 09:32:17,"Op i really feel you need to see the doctor, get some antidepressants, explain how citralopram made you feel and they'll prescribe something different, they'll lift the fog a tiny bit at a time until you feel a bit better, they can really help, depression really is a horrible illness, you say its a catastrophy of events that have made you low, that's how depression starts in some people, other people just get it randomly, it doesn't follow a specific type of person. I agree with the pp, find a hobby, don't worry about a job just yet, It'll only add to your stress. Find a hobby that gets you out of the house, a knitting club or exersise class are usually good ones. That way you'll make new friends too. Make your task today to ring the doctor, just tell the receptionist you feel its depression, the doc will want to see you quickly, if you cant face getting out today, make the appointment for tomorrow, that's your challenge tomorrow, get up, get dressed, go docs, done. I suffer badly too, and recently been given meds, I don't even think I spoke to my doctor, I just cried, I may have mumbled prozac. I find one task a day makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something. And that i'm not so hopeless/worthless. I hope you can do this op."

Imcrackingup,Sun 09-Oct-16 21:50:33,"wind I emphasise with so much you've said. I am currently not in a good place, very similar situation to you, on meds, seeing a psychiatrist and struggling...But I was suicidally depressed a long time ago - I'm not quite that bad at the moment and I am not going back there. I can't - I'm terrified of going there again. I don't think I would survive. So I am doing everything in my power not to. It is hard but I know it can only get worse if I don't. I don't think I have a choice I think the worst thing is having too much time to think and nothing positive to think about. Is there something- anything - you can do to occupy your time/mind? Even doing puzzles or an online course - anything as long as you have something else to think about apart from you and your life. And preferably using your brain - things like gardening are good to keep busy but you also have the opportunity to think - to analyse and that isn't all a good thing. I think I would drop job hunting for now - it would give you a purpose but it could back fire. I have a very part time flexible job -work from home, not well paid, no real future. It does give me something to think about but then it also makes things harder as I struggle to do things I have to and feel like I am fucking that up to...even though there is noone really to discipline me. Lack of concentration/focus - everything - makes it so much harder -so I am frustrated and angry with myself too...for making it harder than it needs to be. What I am doing is making a real effort to make small changes...take fairy steps. It is hard -but I really don't think I have a choice -unless I just give up and I am not ready for that yet (plus I have DCs and I can't do that to them - I knew someone whose DM committed suicide - they never got over it).Which means doing little things - like I get dressed as soon as I get out of bed - not washed and dressed, not showered, not dressed enough to go out but not still in my PJs. I straighten the bed - a psychological plus. Then I waste hours staring at a computer screen - not doing my work ...playing solitaire or on MN ..anything but what I should be doing.I also try and keep the house vaguely tidy - so force myself to do certain jobs on certain days. Nothing huge - just hoover one room, empty the bins, etc. Then I feel like I've achieved something. Also I have lots (hundreds!) of silly little jobs like tidy a kitchen drawer - I have them on a to do list -I add to it when I see something and try and do one every few days/week. Ticking it off a list and seeing things ticked off also lets you know what you have achieved. I also try and reorganise things like drawers - something to think about whilst doing them. I have also been trying to force myself to walk rather than drive to the local shop (10-15mins in total). Exercise is really good for your mental health but again it lets your mind wander - I have been walking fighting back the tears, feeling terrible. And frightened that I felt like carrying on walking- I was thinking about someone who did that - committed suicide in a remote but beautiful place and they walked miles to get there. You really have to do something /anything - no matter what, no matter how small to start moving forward...don't worry about the past - you can't change it. Don't worry about the future just now. Worry about surviving - and you can deal with the future when you are stronger. Don't let yourself think about anything but here and now and tiny positive achievementsI fucking hate Depression - it is hell . But I know it can pass and you will be able to find small amounts of happiness -just it is hard to believe that "
gratesnakes,Sun 09-Oct-16 22:15:29,"Hello OP, please go to a GP. Print out some of your posts here for them to read if you think you will struggle to explain yourself. Tell them that you would like to try different meda and different therapy this time. You sound really depressed but you can get better I am sure. My sister was a professional type but struggled to find work in recent years due to depression. Anti depressants have really worked for her so there really is hope. She did not want to go back into a competitive workplace and she now works part time as a carer for old people and she finds it very satisfying.You are probably much too young to be menopausal but if you have any reason to suspect that you are you could also mention that to the GP."
LifeAsWeKnowIt,Sun 19-Feb-17 23:33:26,"I am in desperate need of help. I'm 21 All my life I have had trouble with so many things; I used to self harm I am severely depressed (on tablets) Have anxiety to the max (also on tablets) I cannot tell the time unless it's 12hr I don't know my left and rights I have the shortest attention span My short term memory is atrocious I often get my words muddled up when talking I'm over sensitive to noise (I hate the cinema and nightclubs) I'm impulsive, I need things yesterday!! I have barely any sense of time, speed, distance etc. I find it hard to follow instructions (my mum used to ask my to run upstairs get her 2 things and I'd always forget) I'm always late and forget the most important things such as my theory test even though I've got it written down and panic that id forget I talk excessively to the point I feel like I am going to explode I can't spell for shit. Without autocorrect and google it would look like a 6 year old wrote this I procrastinate to the extreme I have trouble staying motivatedMy school reports were ""So and So is clever but is easily distracted, she needs to apply herself more and work harder"" I left school with 1 GCSE and I feel I was failed! I had extra lessons outside of school as well. I was tested for dyslexia in college came back I had it but it was never noted nor taken into account. I was suspended often and had a lot of dentitions. I really do want to learn but I could never understand and if I didn't get it I never did but if I got it I excelled. Anyway I really need to get a diagnosis as I'm doing a degree from home and I need to be able to put down my problems so my tutor is aware and it is taken into account unlike at school. It's a struggle when people think you are dumb, maybe I am but I need help either way! Thank you if you got this far, I hope someone can guide me in the right direction. Also my parents put it down to me being 'dumb' so that is all I've known to be but I think there is a big underlying problem."
NataliaOsipova,Mon 20-Feb-17 20:45:06,"Please don't worry, OP. I'm a SAHM and my DCs had fish fingers for supper and the house looks like a bomb has gone off in it....Seriously - don't worry. Do the best you can - in your own way - for your family and don't give anyone else a second thought. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. I'm brilliant at arranging trips out...but bloody hopeless at doing baking and crafts, for example. Focus on what you are good at.Plus - you say these are new friends you made through your child's school? Give it time. Everyone bigs themselves up at first, partly through fear as, really, you don't all necessarily have anything in common at all - you've just met because you have kids in the same class. So it's bound to be a bit strained at first and so you do see the slightly ""forced"" side of people. If you carry on being friends with them, you'll be having very different conversations this time next year, I'm sure."
Pollyanna9,Sun 19-Feb-17 10:56:46,"Hi all.I've had anxiety since childhood (watching parents rowing (not on the water you understand!!) was enough to trigger that and I suppose if you wanted to label it, you could describe me as a 'high functioning' anxious person! What I mean by that is I push myself very hard to go out to work and to push myself in what can be called my 'career' - I could settle for much easier jobs but I prefer to push myself not least because I'm the main breadwinner (single parent) and have to meet all of the related financial obligations.Where you would see my anxiety would be the fact that I compulsively pick my skin so it's damaged and scarred, that if I'm going somewhere not in the normal run of journeys/destinations I plan it out to the nth degree reviewing parking, looking on streetview so I'll recognise the entrance, reviewing the parking costs and payment methods, looking at the route etc etc etc etc.When I was about 17 I discovered alcohol and the wondrous joy of being so pissed you can be at a distance from your stress and the CONSTANT feeling of heightened concern about everything. Of course I wasn't diagnosed with this when I was a child and I didn't realise what it was for a long long time. When I had my DS I was off the charts anxious resulting in me trying to control every aspect of his care (never possible with a newborn) and it ramped up to a level I couldn't believe. I would also be anxious if the kids were say jumping on the bed - in CASE they fell off and hurt themselves - again, anxiety level way over and above anything that is normal. As I say, you'd not necessarily know this is how I am if you see me/met me. But all of this I suppose trying to suppress it is working less and less and my skin picking is going mental and I just feel so hyped up all the time I can barely relax at all. I sleep badly and wake exhausted.I want to go to the GP to get something medicinal to address this. I'm not depressed - but I do need something to 'take the edge off'. What is the likelihood of getting beta blockers prescribed or there was another drug someone said on here (darn, can't remember it) that not only does it make you feel calmer but it also helps you sleep, begins with m....It's just my GPs are often SO averse to actually DOING anything for you it drives me bloody mad. I did go in about anxiety once before and was offered referral to a mental health service but it would have resulted in going to regular sessions for CBT or similar and to be honest, the thought of having to try and organise that, take time off work and so on just makes me even more stressed! I'd like to manage it in another way.So I guess I'm asking what are the key things I need to get across that are most likely to result in the GP actually taking my request seriously and looking at a prescribing route? What is it that makes them think oh ok this person needs this type of solution and I'm happy to get them it rather than let me suggest other options and not be happy to suggest ones involving drugs?I know it's never preferable to be put on pills but for myself, it would be preferable to feeling like this every day of my life."
Pollyanna9,Sun 19-Feb-17 11:55:07,"Thank you. I feel like I'm at the point where waiting weeks for CBT plus the weeks it would take for it to work, are not going to address quickly enough, at this time, the crushing exhaustion that goes with being anxious all the time. I do absolutely agree with CBT being the premier solution but a. the timing's not right it won't be quick enough and b. unless there are remote access options certainly at the moment, it would be a no go for me at this time (but am certainly not ruling it out for sure).I think I'm so bloody anxious about going in there and just being turned back round again that I don't know what to say to convince them that I do need some immediate help to get me over a hump. Went in there for neck pain I've had on and off for 30 years. Got told a few (pathetic) neck exercises (""roll your neck, shrug your shoulders) and if that doesn't work well, you'll have to live with it..."" !! Actually, it was postural - I had to pay to see my local fantastic physio who sorted the whole thing out for me. So my experience of the GP is that they are largely extremely unhelpful and not wanting to action actual treatments.Last time I went in about anxiety I had to be assessed at a special panel because that CCG didn't commission MH support for people who skin picked - apparently I would have gotten an immediate referral if I was cutting!Honestly. I do resent that I look after myself 99% of the time. When I go the GP it's because I've got to the point where I actually need help. And so often I either don't get it or there are barriers and I come out feeling worse than when I went in. Going to the GP could make you feel depressed when you were fine when you went in!"
Woollymammoth63,Sun 19-Feb-17 15:08:38," Ho Pollyanna sorry to hear you are feeling so anxious. It's horrible and I have been there. GPs are not MH experts and some are better than others in terms of their understanding and communication. In terms of diazepam, it can be given short term in patients considered safe physically ( not at risk eg pneumonia) , not interacting with other medications, and short term relief only, and in someone who is not suicidal.it is risky as diazepam etc are addictive, and can cause depression of breathing etc. so it is at the individual GPs discretion if he feels this is safe, and a good idea. Alternative might be an antidepressant , but again a check that the person is not suicidal, and letting them know that Ads can (but don't always )make these feelings worse, usually for a few weeks in which case to immediately seek medical help. I would think see what they say, you don't have to wait for a routine appt, you can ask for the on call doctor, who usually will call you back and then probably ask to see you. It's tricky, but I would think counselling/ CBT would help , I would think it worth considering to go along with the mental health team counselling referral. Have you looked at online mindfulness, mood juice, no panic, Mind website, I think there might be a MInd helpline, and the Samaritans. Don't despair, this will improve, you will get help, but if you feel you need urgent help go through AE or out of hours GP who will get you the crisis team or AE. The GP can refer you direct to the crisis team if he felt you were in distress, it's really best to be honest and discuss with him/ her. All the best"
Imogenblue,Mon 20-Feb-17 00:11:38,"This may not go down well, I don't know, I'm just stuck and unsure as to what I should do.Diagnosed with depression and anxiety, always been told to take meds for it but never have. One primary reason is that I continually worry about side affects (I don't even take pain killers). Another -probably lesser reason to many people- is what happened when I was given a prescription for some at the pharmacy and was taken into a small room. Basically, I was told I needed to be an active person or I was going to put on a lot of weight on the meds. Really not what you want to hear when already depressed. However, the only exercise I can do is walking (various problems, waiting for physio) and not for long. So, this weight gain comment really puts me off taking something, as someone who already has body image issues.Is this silly? Should I suck it up?"
Itisnoteasybeingdifferent,Mon 20-Feb-17 05:26:36,If you have genuine problems doing exercise (plantar faciatis etc) I suggest you soeak to GP about an altnative med. No point in putting on weight and becoming more immobile then more depressed because you are putting on weight.
wantoscreamatwashingpile,Mon 20-Feb-17 17:39:09,"Just wondering if anyone has had any good effects with it really? I'd say I'm probably more anxious than depressed (it ebbs and flows). I've never tried anything from the drs (apart from beta blockers, which I have before presentations ) Xx"
oregon1985,Sun 12-Feb-17 14:39:20,"But I don't know what to say. I think I'm depressed or something, I don't know. I've always been, I guess down is the right word. As long as I can remember I've always felt like it would be better if I weren't here. But the last month has been tough (end of relationship with the love of my life, though we're working through it we're not back together).I'm not coping very well. I can't do anything, I have no motivation. I spent the last few days just staring blankly at the tv. I have random hours a few days a week where I feel like I'm might be ok, I get positive and a small amount of motivation then it's right back to feeling empty. I can't blame my relationship ending on this because it's been like this forever but it's intensified a lot the last few weeks. Most days I'll just sit by myself all day. I can barely bring myself to get up and shower. I don't talk to anyone. I just sit here. At work in very good at putting on a cheery front. People think I'm bubbly and friendly but it's all just so people don't ask me if I'm ok, because I feel like I will break down if someone knows how I really feel. I feel broken. And empty. I know I should probably talk to the dr but I don't know what to say. I've never been good at talking to people face to face and I feel pathetic."
Latara,Mon 23-Jul-12 10:51:24,"I'm on 225mg Venlafaxine M/R daily - it took 3 months to work properly so you have to be patient - but it's definitely been worth it & i recommend trying it!I still get short depressive periods (& feel suicidal at times) for an hour or a few hours during mood swings (got BPD). Often this happens daily; but as soon as the depressive period passes off i feel ok, like i was never depressed.Like today; i feel very happy & lively.If you have epilepsy - be aware that Venlafaxine lowers the seizure threshold - that's the one side effect that is a problem for me - i don't get full tonic-clonic seizures thanks to my epilepsy meds, but it's not fully controlled. So i get very short absence, myoclonic & deja vu seizures daily; & those seizures contribute to memory loss which is frustrating... Oh yes & best to avoid alcohol, even 1 glass of wine stops Venlafaxine being effective for me for up to 2 days later.You may feel hungrier so snack on apples / Ryvita & jam - nothing fattening.I'm happy to put up with less controlled epilepsy though as it means not getting the horrible depression i had; just would not wish bad depression on anyone.Good luck, you definitely should try it - i don't remember any other side effects but you may get drowsy etc for a while - but hopefully that will wear off after few weeks."
confusedandemployed,Mon 23-Jan-17 12:52:41,"I think you need an advocate. Contact CAB, they will help as much as possible and will be able to signpost you to other organisations that can help. It will be MUCH easier to deal with all the official / financial stuff if you're not alone.And GP obviously. You are chronically depressed and need urgent help. "
Flowersandcats,Mon 23-Jan-17 13:33:03,"And chuck them pain killers away !!!I'm not sure how to explain this (like I said I am having trouble distinguishing real feelings/memories from false feelings/memories atm). I understand that there is a difference as far as health service provision is concerned between ""feeling suicidal"" and ""having a plan in place to end your life"". I think when I bought the tablets (5 shops, 100+ paracetamol) it was with the idea of ending my life. But right now, there is something oddly comforting in the thought that if I did need immediate psychiatric help, I could point to the paracetamol and say ""Plan in place!""I do want to end it. But in a ""never having existed in the first place"" way. If I could wipe out my existence so no-one ever knew I existed, I would do that in a heartbeat. But I can't. I have to keep reminding myself that killing myself would be far worse for my daughter than any of the other shitty possible outcomes of my current situation."
TENSHI,Thu 26-Jan-17 10:07:37,"Let me tell you something I did when overwhelmed, depressed and couldn't cope at all.I had young dc and a business. I preferred just to stuff any brown envelopes under the sofa or in a cupboard.One day I had a letter from the tax office asking to see my accounts of the last 3 years as part of a random survey. I can't tell you how much it threw me into a panic. I was unable to sleep and just ignored it. The next sequence of events remain hazy. I got a call from the tax office as I had failed to turn up to the meeting (I think). They asked me for my figures for the last year and I just plucked a figure out of thin air and told them.As I'm not sure the sequence of events, may be they asked to see me/the accounts.. well I knew I couldn't justify any of it so I just rang them up and confessed that I had just put a random figure down and actually had no idea what the real amount was as I didn't know and I was too upset to find out.They were absolutely marvellous. Told me not to worry, to gather all the paper work that I had and just bring it all in for them to sort out for me.I saw the kindliest lady and the kindliest fatherly sort of gentleman at the tax office in the next few weeks while they went through it all with me and told me next time I was struggling to just come in and ask for help. That they were trying to change the face of their work and it needn't be a scary place.So please don't despair as I did and put it off. Just confess and admit you're in a pickle/mess/overwhelmed/cannot cope and you will be surprised how your frankness and honesty will disarm people and you will see their compassionate side.Good luck "
Flowersandcats,Mon 30-Jan-17 19:59:31,"It's just over a week since I wrote my original post. I was feeling so fucking hopeless at that point. It seemed impossible that there was any way out of my situation. I don't know how it's all going to pan out, obviously. But the difference between how I was feeling then and how I am feeling now is huge. I know everyone says that it's better once you face up to things but I couldn't bring myself to do it. It's totally true though. I even managed to get through the whole CAB appointment without crying.No post today. I actually enjoy checking the mailbox and finding it empty. It did occur to me opening all my unopened post (some of it dating back to 2014) that if I didn't owe people money and have DDs constantly bouncing in my bank account, I'd barely get any postal correspondence at all.And thanks for your post bigmouthstrikesagain. People who volunteer at CAB are total fucking heroes."
Ladybird1979,Sat 18-Feb-17 09:18:03,Don't just stop it. It takes 2 weeks to work into your system so be patient. You need to be weaned off - i had exactly same issue but no one told me I couldn't just stop taking them. I ceased and became suicidal and self harmed badly.Please don't just stop go to see your GP.I ended up controlling my depression and anxiety through exercise which helped so much and gradually came off the pills.
meltownmary,Fri 17-Feb-17 18:51:05,"Hello,Had a devastating loss nearly four years ago. Got on with things pretty soon after. Was numb I think. Lots of other awful things happened at the same time that took up a lot of my brain space. But was kind of ok. Or so I thought.Anyway, in the last six months I am in bits with anxiety and all the rest of it. It's coming to the surface again. Shit.Went to GP yesterday in despair, and he recommended counselling. OK so far, then said I should consider Escitalopram for the anxiety. Gave me a script and I filled it, but I am full of anxiety and will not take them. I know, but that's me.I am not taking any other meds at all for anything else. He also gave me a weeks supply of 3mg Lexotan to take if I get panicky. They are god's gift, but I have to be careful not to become dependent on them.Jesus will this anxiety ever go away. It is awful.I really am banking on the counselling.Has anyone else suffered complex unresolved grief and how are you now if you did.Thanks so much."

A was the victim in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic, kids went to live elsewhere as A couldn't seem to get things sorted. A's personality is completely different to how they were a long time ago. I think the person they used to be is completely lost. The person left doesn't have much emotion about anything and is unbelievably submissive.I have for a very long time felt they were severely depressed. A is only now admitting they need help and has asked me to go to the gp with them tomorrow. A admitted they considered killing themselves today but due to another close family member being pregnant, in their words, ""won't do it yet""It is really difficult to get a dr's appointment at their surgery but I feel it must be tomorrow.

EmeraldIsle100,Mon 13-Feb-17 15:26:20,"Does anyone experience hot and cold sweats at night? My DD aged 19 has had mental health problems since she was about 15/16 and spent the last 6 months in a psychiatic ward due to bipolar, depression, anxiety, eating disorder, self harm and suicidal ideation. She was discharged recently and is doing quite well. She is on lithium which thankfully has eliminated the suicidal ideation. She seems a lot better in herself and thankfully she is getting a break from really disturbing frightening thoughts.Her eating disorder veers between anorexia and bulimia but at the moment she seems to be eating and is not too thin. I don't really know how often she is making herself sick after food but she says it has reduced significantly. She has started to experience night sweats which are hot and then cold and she wakes up freezing. I wonder if anyone has had this problem. She is on diazapam, lithium, an anti depressant and a mood stabilizer. I would very much appreciate any advice that you may have. Thanks very much."
sabzii,Fri 10-Feb-17 19:17:50,"Yes, when I was in my late teens and depressed with anorexia. These days I'm very confident about how I look. Do you believe you actually are 'different' or is it a state of mind? Have you had any talking therapy eg CBT/NLP/counselling?You say you feel 'unpolished'. How much time do you spend grooming? Do you get your hair cut and coloured regularly, spend time blow-drying it, do your nails, shop for clothes that fit well, work out regularly? There is so much you can do to achieve the 'look' you want. Grooming and dressing well are skills you can learn. What is it about your appearence you dislike?"
neveradullmoment99,Fri 10-Feb-17 20:52:42," Honestly, beauty can come just as much from within. You have to learn to love yourself or even like yourself. I have met plenty people in my life time who are not stunningly beautiful or even pretty but they are such lovely people that they exude beauty and are just lovely to be around. I am also quite sure you are not as bad as you think you are. You have youth on your side too. You need to focus on other things that make you happy and as for your looks, focus on the parts you like and those that you dislike try to make the best of. I am wondering if you are a bit depressed. Maybe a bit of depression is making you feel so bad about yourself. Maybe because you feel lonely, you are focusing on your looks when in reality you are a bit depressed that in turn can make you feel down, lonely and unhappy and you are maybe blaming how others interact with you on your looks? Just a thought. Maybe worth trying to confront what is upsetting you deep down? Could you talk to the doctor about how you feel?"
crazydogladyo,Thu 16-Feb-17 02:14:40,"I feel exactly the same but without the suicidal ideation. I've only started feeling like it again recently though. I was doing a lot better. I do take 50mg Sertraline for anxiety, but it doesn't seem to help with this."

If I messaged between sessions she would always reply but wouldn't engage which I totally respected as you can counsel over text, she would advise me to come in face to face. I have reached out as you have in despair a few times. She always replied promptly. I would feel very hurt in your posistion.

Lilipops,Mon 13-Feb-17 17:55:44,"I have been taking a low dose of Prozac (fluoxetine) for a good few years and generally I think they help. However, although I am much more tolerant and calm about things, I just feel slightly that I am not 'me'. I definitely get on with my husband much better when I'm on them as I don't question anything, I.e. Problems within our relationship. I am not sure if I am depressed as opposed to just not happy and taking them just numbs everything. I feel that when I come off them (I have just run out and so haven't taken any for a few days) I am much less accepting of things in my life. I wonder if I stop taking them I might do something about my life as I will feel the need to sort things out. I might push my husband to try to go to marriage counselling or something rather than just trudging along as we are. I don't know where to go or who to talk to for help. I don't know if I will be wasting the doctors time if I make an appointment to talk to them about it as ultimately it's my decision. I have never told any of my friends that I take them as I'm basically ashamed of the stigma of them."

I'm not an expert on this but in case it helps I have recently had some CBT (I didn't have severe problems/suicidal thoughts or anything but I felt myself starting to lose my grip and didn't want it going out if control). It was scary thinking about it because i sort of didn't want to confront myself. I wasn't sure what the problem was exactly, except that I didn't like myself and wasn't happy that I was (over)reacting badly to things and had got myself stuck in a pattern of behaviour I could see but not stop. My therapist asked me some questions and we picked a particular place to start and went from there. It really helped me although it was a bit scary to start with. I feel like I have tools to spot the behaviour patterns I was stuck in and alter them. I'm so glad I did it. I hope you get an appointment soon and it helps."

My main problem at the moment is anxiety and it is becoming overwhelming for me. I am going to see a counsellor which I hope will help. I know the theory behind anxiety and am fine at giving other people advice on coping, but can't do it myself.Beta blockers were mentioned to me before but the gp said they might not be suitable for me as my blood pressure is naturally quite low. However I'm starting to feel quite desparate as the anxiety is building and although I don't feel depressed as I was, I do feel it's all getting too painful to cope with and I am worried about feeling suicidal again.So I'd be interested to hear about anyone's experiences of BBs. Side effects, how effective have they been, have they lowered your BP, are they easy to come off?Thanks"
Jaytee38,Tue 14-Feb-17 00:37:36, I've no idea where you can get it. However I think studies have shown it increases suicidal thoufhts/ideation so not safe to go on if not under the care of a doctor.
Saloire,Mon 13-Feb-17 02:11:28,"Sorry, a bit of a long post coming up:  So, I'm 32 weeks pregnant, due in April. I have a history of postnatal depression, plus winter depression which has recurred since my DD (now five years old) was born, and currently battle with insomnia. I'm not on any medication for any of these, but i'm not averse to it in the future.  So in December, my mum had a breakdown, and is relying on me relatively heavily for emotional support over the phone as I am 500 miles away so can't go to see her due to work and my daughter's school pick ups and drop-offs etc. Mum is currently on sertraline, and is also receiving CBT, but it doesn't seem to be making any difference. She phoned me today to say she felt suicidal and she just couldn't cope any more. I really don't know what to do to help her, and her whole demeanour plus the things she talks about are acting as a massive trigger for me. I hate seeing her like this, it makes me feel sad, makes me feel guilty for not being there, and it also makes me realise what I look like when I'm in that state, and I never want to go back there again. Of course the fear of all this is making me not sleep, which normally starts the cycle of anxiety for me. I've been bingeing on sugar to try and numb the anxious feelings, have been running away from doing anything remotely CBT or meditation related as it just reminds me of how it's not working for my mum. I've been trying to mask my feelings from my partner, so as not to make him feel like my mum is making me feel right now. I know he would be supportive, but I just don't want to cause him the same horrible feelings I get when I look at my mum.  I know I'm not helping myself, but I'm just a lost as to what to do and in what order. So, should I be phoning the doctor on my mum's behalf to tell him she's not getting any better and that she needs to up her dose of antidepressants, or should I be looking after myself first, admitting to my feelings and tackling my sugar addiction? My baby is due in under eight weeks, and I feel unprepared emotionally for what I know is to come. I feel I should be managing everything better in terms of looking after my mental health, and I know I'm not, there's just so much going on right now and I don't know where to start.  Thanks for reading if you got this far XXX"
AnxiousCarer,Mon 13-Feb-17 17:23:02,"Speaking from experience put yourself and your (and babys) health first. If you go under then you can't support anyone else, and right now you need to be getting in the best place mentally yourself for when baby arrives.Definately share with DP. DH and I both have mental health problems and have learnt the hard way that trying to protect each other by keeping them to our selves generally backfires spectacularly!Your DM is obviously having a really hard time at the moment, but she is an adult and she needs to be the one going back to her GP and discussing how she is feeling, including the suicidal feelings. Make sure she has the samaritans number, and knows that she can go to A&E or contact crisis team, if she feels she needs to. I also think you need to set some boundries with her. Explain kindly that you are struggling yourself and can't offer her the support you would like to at the moment. Maybe set days and times when you will or wont be available. I know when my DM was going through a hard time a few years ago I wouldn't always answer the phone, if I didn't feel up to it."

DeleteOrDecay,Wed 11-Jan-17 01:03:59,"Great idea for a threadI have been depressed and anxious for a long long time, I can't actually pinpoint a time where it all began but it's got progressively worse over the years and I think I've been in denial about the state of my mental health. Last week, with the support of my dp I finally plucked up the courage to see my GP who was understanding and I have been on 50mg sertraline for 5 days so far. For some reason I had this irrational fear that I would be brushed off or that I was just being dramatic so I kept putting off going to the doctors. Wish I'd gone sooner now.Been having quite a few side effects from the meds such as dry mouth, unsettled sleep, tiredness, loss of appetite, feeling restless/fidgety, feeling 'strange' and more panicky. The GP did say this could happen for the first few weeks but despite the above side effects I do feel like the meds have been helping. I definitely feel less depressed, I haven't had as many negative thoughts, I've felt more motivated about doing stuff around the house and I mostly feel I've been less snappy with dp and the kids although I still have my moments. I know it can take time for them to kick in fully.Fingers crossed once the side effects wear off I continue to make improvements. I feel like I'm actually starting to feel normal now and life seems to be more bearable, which is weird as I had forgotten what normal feels like."

Thinking of the best way to do it and make it look like an accident.Nearly 30 years now since my first attempt. Fucking long time."
MeadowHay,Wed 11-Jan-17 22:58:29,"Welcome everyone . Delete Well done on going to see your GP, that is a big step and means you are on your way to recovery. Good luck with the sertraline, it can take 4-5 weeks for antidepressants to really start working so stick with it and side-effects mostly wear off after the first couple of weeks too for most people. When I first started citalopram a few years ago I was dreadfully ill for the first week with a vast array of side effects, they gradually lessened in the second week and then most of them went away bar a few trivial things and then the medicine really helped me for a few years. Lollipop Glad your placement is still going well. I went to see my dad this evening and had a nice meal out with him which was nice. Tomorrow morning I have an appointment with my study advisor at uni which DH is going to take me to to make sure I actually go and help me talk to her in case I can't talk due to anxiety. It will be about my presentation and to see if there is anything she can do to help me with it . Testi Christmas is often a particularly tough time for people. I too felt particularly suicidal in the run up to it and made my first plans in awhile. Which I have now abandoned thankfully."
Rueben,Wed 11-Jan-17 23:11:51,"Hello all! Great thread idea. I can relate to a lot of what has been said. I have depression and anxiety, and I'm a first year uni student.

I definitely couldn't cope in a sales or call centre role so I understand where you're coming from with that. Work can be a massive factor when it comes to MH.Today was okay up until this evening where I felt what I can only describe as a black could descend upon me. It begun when we went out for a meal, the food was disappointing, dp is giving up smoking and didn't put a nicotine patch on so has been quite unpleasant this afternoon which in turn made me act unpleasant back (I didn't know he hadn't put a patch on) as I couldn't understand what his problem was and his mood was making me anxious.Haven't had that feeling since starting the meds, not sure if it's due to the meds or if it was just coincidental as I do go through phases of feeling 'okay'. Not brilliant by any means, but sort of 'stable'. Does anyone else? I mean more often than not I definitely feel I am depressed but have occasions where I'm not so bad.

I have been depressed since about 10 or 11, low mood before too. Lots of little things have happened. I'm on Srtralinw and been on ADs since 12.Hello everyone else"
UnbornMortificado,Sun 15-Jan-17 15:21:57,Quark I think that is classed as suicidal intentions sort of. It's wanting to commit suicide without having plans to currently do so.The pregnancy would be classed as a protective factor. Have we spoke on a thread earlier?Has any one had any luck with self care?Purple I think anxiety is worse to have then bi-polar personally. I've suffered with both and it's the anxiety that fucks me up more.
bellatrixlestrange124,Mon 16-Jan-17 15:01:12,"Hi, I'm another new one! I have anxiety and depression, though I'm never sure when one ends and the other one starts with me!I've started a new job recently, it's high pressure and there's a lot to do, but because of my anxiety I spend so much of the time feeling frozen with fear and am unable to get on with anything. Which then means my to do list gets bigger and I feel more and more overwhelmed. And then I get depression that I can't even do the simple things that I know I can do. It all feels so hopeless and I'm so unhappy. And then I get chased for things and I feel even more panicked. I don't want to lose my job over this, I worked so hard to get it.Purple could you link me to the FB group too please?"
MeadowHay,Wed 25-Jan-17 08:39:39,"mrsdarcy Glad you've found a new counsellor who is more supportive of you. I agree when you have severe anxiety/agoraphobia you need to take baby steps and recognise all your achievements. It can be really hard. I can't really go anywhere on my own other than uni and work - which is the same place as I work in my SU. It is horrible feeling trapped at home sometimes. Rachie Sorry to hear you're feeling bad anxiety-wise. If you're really struggling, make that GP appt, they can help you. Inside Also sorry to hear how low you're feeling, please try to keep safe. If you need to talk you can call Samaritans remember or if you're in urgent crisis situation you can call 999 or go to A&E. If you are feeling so suicidal I agree it's a good idea to go to see your GP urgently so they can help you. I know how it feels to feel that awfully law, I hope today seems a little better.  I am up so early this morning and feel not too exhausted/sleepy which is a big achievement. I am about to go to work now. I have to sit on a stall today later at work with a couple of other students and entice people to come and talk to me and ask them things, eeeeeek. Really anxious but I won't be on my own so will give it my best shot and keep taking deep breaths!"
goneloopy,Sun 12-Feb-17 11:24:38,"Brief history - SAHM, 2DC, DH, been on AD on and off for years. Currently on sertraline 100mg. Been doing ok on it, but recently started feeling very low again, tired all the time, isolating myself from family and friends, don't even want to leave the house. Don't know why I'm posting really, just wanted to get it out so to speak. Should I go back to my GP? Just want to shake this feeling of apathy and tiredness. I don't want my DC to have such a bad mother who doesn't want to take them places, who has no motivation to leave the house. I am drifting further and further away from my DH too. We barely speak, just co exist. I'm just tired of it all. I'm not suicidal as I'd never do that to my DC but I can see how easy it would be for that to happen. "

LuluBlue,Tue 01-Mar-11 18:08:44,"This morning I made my first post on another thread (on being nonmaternal), before I found this one. I am 38 yrs old, 8 weeks pregnant with my first and am horribly depressed and ambivalent. I have never felt maternal, had sworn off children-- a choice that my husband (who is much more a ""broody type"") respected, while most likely harboring the hope that I would someday see the light. Well, here I am, entering the 2nd month of an unplanned pregnancy and I am just nothing but blind-terrified of everything I read in this thread-- because it resonates, all of it. The loss of self, the depression, the resentment. I nodded so much as I read--the idea that parenthood in general is a sort of conspiracy... I just wanted to say that I am grateful for everyone's candor. What you are confirming are the worst fears I have for motherhood myself. I have friends who swear up and down that they felt as I did but then the baby arrived and -- poof!--it's been nothing but rainbows and chickadees ever since. I know that they are probably also shielding me from the worst of it, for both of our sakes. That said, I also truly believe that some women are meant to be mothers-- that they really have that ""calling."" That they enjoy it naturally and weather the lumps and bumps of it so much easier that types like me who never felt remotely interested in the first place. I know that even posting these thoughts anonymously could not have been easy, since to admit maternal regret is the last bastion of taboo in this very childcentric world. I hope many of the women here can feel better just for knowing that they are far from alone in their thoughts. And I just want to say, to InPraiseofBacchus and others, that this thread HAS made a difference. To me anyway. It is not yet too late for me, though time is wasting. I think I have decided for good to terminate and will make the appointment today. I do hope somenone might respond to this, if only to let me know that my thougts, too, were heard. My best to you all."

LuluBlue,Wed 02-Mar-11 20:43:28,"Thank you so much, Badground,*Acanthus*, and Arcadia. For what it's worth, I met with my gynecologist today and she put me an antidepressant. I am hoping that in a week or so that the clouds will begin to lift and I will be able to decipher whether I am merely depressed in general (I have a history of depression) or if the pregnancy is the root cause of it. She urged me to give it some time to make my decision. I will do so, but do feel, each day, that time is ""running out.""

WearyMumof3,Sun 12-Feb-17 19:12:44,"Hello,As the subject says, tomorrow I'm at the Drs, I've tried going several times over the past few years with several set backs, I guess what I'm looking for from mumsnet is some encouragement and words of wisdom so I don't turn into my usual quiet self and don't get my point across to the gp...Ever since my early teens I have suffered with depression, I seem to have one to two weeks of being ok then I sink into a heavy depression and feel suicidal. I was put onto fluoxetine at 14 for about a year.. my parents (my mother) didn't know what to do with me, I was in and out of hospital, didn't finish school and was sent to live with grandparents...Through a stroke of luck I met my husband and started to build my life, we fell pregnant with my now 9yo son... after he was born I had severe PND, I was referred and saw a counsellor but was told i could only have one session, I think that set off my dislike of mental health support on the NHS, how I feel towards my son is different compared to my younger 2, he has high functioning autism which I know is my fault and my inability to love him as I know I should since birth... I do love him of course but I don't feel like I know him and often wish my husband would leave me and take my eldest with him... I didn't feel like this with my younger two but it I did notice the difference in how I felt about my eldest- I took myself to the Drs and was told to call samaritans... I went back and was given an appointment for talking mental health Derbyshire, that appointment was cancelled on the morning I was due to go and they couldn't offer me another one at the time. So I've spent the last year just plodding along.Here and now after my periods returned in the summer and my husband had the snip last year I've noticed that my monthly severe depression is back, I've been using an app to track my moods and cycles, I feel suicidal in the week or so leading up to my period, my mood settles somewhat but still extremely anxious and easily wound up... it looks like premenstrual dysphoric disorder is what has been my problem for the past 14 years, but how do I go about getting help, do I ask for help treating that in hope it will tie in the on going pnd and the lack of bond I have with my eldest? What do I do if I'm fobbed off with the samaritans again? I'm desperate to help and to feel well, I may not have described my issues eloquently here but this it what they are in a nutshell, what help should I be asking for?"
kerstina,Sun 12-Feb-17 10:57:09, Sorry I am so late replying I have had a week from hell so poorly ended up in hospital A&E three times . Got so dehydrated had to have a drip as was choking and gagging couldn't eat or drink anything for a week . So disappointed with my doctor as the only help he offered to help with withdrawal was an app for my phone then when I felt like I was dying more or less said he didn't believe it was anxiety that I must be physically ill as I looked so unwell. So much for mental health being a priority they don't want to know unless you are suicidal . How are you now mummy squirrel please keep in touch ?
CoffeeBreakIn5,Sat 11-Feb-17 19:11:11,"A year ago I made the decision to leave my job, I'd been treated like I just didn't matter at work anymore and it was really affecting my mental health. I'd been prescribed Citalopram at the time but soon realised that I needed to leave that environment so I handed in my notice. As predicted, things got worse during my notice period and I ended up taking sick leave. None of my colleagues contacted me, I wanted to say goodbye so I went into work on a day that a few other people were leaving the company. I asked my boss if this was ok and got the go ahead, I messaged a few people I'd previously been close to at work so they knew. When I got there no one gave a damn, leaving cards and presents were being given out and I received only one from the company and that was given as an after thought. I left that day and vowed to have nothing to do with any of them. I should add that there have never been any grievances aired about me but a colleague had tried to blame me for something whilst I was off but had been sent off by my boss with a flea in his ear due to it having nothing to do with me.A few months later I was added to a message group on Facebook by a group of people I didn't work directly with but who I'd been friendly with over the years (I'd been there 15 years). I was invited to a gathering they were having and I went, I had a nice time and they told me how bad they felt about the way I'd left and how I'd been ignored. I told them it was absolutely fine and that I'd missed them, no hard feelings etc etc and that was that. We've swapped a few messages and would most likely be organising a meet up in the next few weeks.I found out through Facebook that there was a huge leaving party for a colleague last night, one of the people in the message group had posted publicly about how lovely it was to send of this amazing person and how great it was that so many employees, past and present, had been able to attend. I'd heard absolutely nothing about this party, I'd worked with the man the whole time I'd worked there and we were friendly. Loads of ex employees were there. I suffer horrible social anxiety, I'm coming out of a depressed episode and although I don't want to go back to Citalopram I think it's for the best. Because of this I can't tell if my reactions are rational or not - I want to delete them all from Facebook and have nothing more to do with any of them, but is this overreacting? I feel so sad about it, but surely if they've done this then they actually don't care about being friends with me - they'd have invited me if they did? Should I cut them off? Or am I overreacting? They were so lovely to me when I saw them last but now I feel betrayed. What should I do? I feel like doing if I do nothing it's allowing people to treat me badly but if I do something it'd be irrational.Sorry this is long, I'm all mixed up today."
UpOnDown,Tue 17-Jan-17 19:39:49," I'm suicidal. My CMHT know, they phoned this morning, visited this afternoon and offered to phone later too. Surely this is too much? How long will they keep contacting me?"
MagicChanges,Wed 18-Jan-17 20:39:37,"I think the problem is that mental health Trusts are totally short of money and so there is an acute and chronic shortage of beds. Our local Trust has closed a whole dementia ward and cut beds on acute wards by 50% so they are using CPNs or other members of CMHTs to visit daily for patients who really need to be in hospital. They have a term for it here ""Wards without Walls"" - you couldn't make it up!!Incidentally OP it isn't only ""hearing voices"" that prompts an admission. It's true that if someone is suffering a psychotic illness (with hearing voices being a symptom) and is not taking the meds, they may need to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The nature of this illness is that people are deluded so are convinced they are not ill and it's the people around them who are deluded! In such a state they need to be protected for themselves and others. A person can be sectioned if they are a danger to themself or others, and this can be the case for any mental illness.Crisis teams in my experience are not much help - in our MH Trust they will simply tell someone to go to A & E as there is a MH liaison post in A & E. which I suppose is better than nothing. Mind a person would almost certainly have to wait for an age for the the MH liaison person. Of course staff are in a very difficult position knowing that there are no beds available for people who are in desperate need. They will try other hospitals in the trust or further afield, but it's just not right that patients have to travel 30 or more miles away from their home, which can be the case.Upondown do you mind my asking about your mental illness - am assuming it is depression as suicidal thoughts are very common with this illness. Do you mean you are having these thoughts (known as suicide ideation) but don't really think you will act upon them, or is it more serious, and you have made plans. It sounds like it could be the latter as the CMHT are in close contact. Please take all the help you can get. Hope you have someone close at hand who understands the torment of mental illness and can support you."
iveburntthetoast,Sat 11-Feb-17 12:00:35," Yep, I've noticed my CT becoming more stretched and increasing the level of 'crisis' you need to be in. It's not enough to be suicidal--or even to have plans. You just about have to be in the process of killing yourself for them to intervene. Not to mention the state you need to be in to get a hospital bed....."
ovumahead,Thu 08-Sep-11 13:50:38,"Hi there, I've read your thread with interest, after just coming home from the docs today with a prescription for ADs (escitalopram) - feel SO nervous about taking them because of the side effects, and reading about withdrawals on the internet. Plus i'm a bit of a hypochondriac so am always monitoring myself for symptoms of bloody anything!!! I think I'm going to start taking mine tonight, and see how I go. I'm not pregnant or breastfeeding. I think I probably should have started taking these meds years ago - have been feeling depressed on and off for a long while now. Enough is enough! Fingers crossed these meds help us both - would love to compare notes if you're up for it!!!"
friggFRIGG,Thu 08-Sep-11 16:28:38,"actually,scrap that,thats crap,i HAVE been feeling better.today ive put washing out,put another load on.hoovered.made lunch for the DC.washed up.walked DD to nursery (1hr round trip)hoovered.tidyed.started on dinner.this is (embarrassingly) roughly what i would have achieved in 2-3 days a week or two ago.(i would just have gone out immediately and had lunch in town,or done very little and stayed at home.)and the day isnt over yet,i feel more able,when i look around the house at the things i need to do,instead of despairing,and doing nothing,i START.my DD and i are clashing less.some of this is down to DD starting nursery this week.some of it isnt."
unlucky83,Thu 14-Jul-16 23:46:12,"I'm awaiting an appointment in Aug with psychiatry to get assessed and hopefully diagnosed. DD1 was diagnosed at just 14 - but I had suspected for years. I didn't want her labelled but with exams etc looming she was starting to lose it - I thought she was going to stop going to school (which is what I did). The medication transformed her school work. But there are 2 downsides - one she only takes it for school - when it wears off at night she becomes more lively than she was before - it is kind of like a release. And at the weekend/holidays she is also harder to deal with - more bouncy and loud than ever...and in some ways she controls it less as she has an excuse/reason - she isn't trying to be 'normal' any more. Which is probably better for her metal health... but can be a nightmare for me. She is also oppositional - you have to carefully phrase everything so she doesn't see it as an 'order' ... if she feels like you are telling her to do something she won't and the more cross you become with her the more she fights back. I'm 49 and going for a diagnosis cos I am struggling keeping on top of everything - I am the queen of procrastination...everything feels slightly out of control. I have seen what a difference medication made to DD and think if I took when I needed to I could get on top of everything for once and for all and feel happier. (I am back on ADs at the moment -struggled with depression all my life and was suicidal when I was in my 20s)I am addicted to coffee and nicotine - although I vape now on the whole - only have the odd cigarette. I cry when I haven't had a cigarette for a while - I panic and feel like I can't function. I read Allan carrs book about stopping smoking - in it he says remember how awful that first cigarette made you feel - my first cigarette made me feel great . The same is true for coffee - I drink gallons of super strong coffee every day and I really can't function without it. I then read both nicotine and caffeine have been trialled as treatments for ADHD...which was a real ahhhh I get it moment for me -before that I just thought I had an addictive personality. I only took E a couple of times (I became ill and was on serious prescription drugs when I was into that scene - so then couldn't risk it or any other illegal drugs) and it made my brain feel so focused - it was amazing - everything was so clear - I wasn't buzzing I was just super calm and together...I kind of thought that is how it made everyone feel  Only took cocaine once and it had no real noticeable effect on me...that I can remember. I'm still on prescription medication and have dodgy health so daren't risk sneaking some of DD's concerta -although I have been tempted. As to fidgeting - an acquaintance apparently thought I was an addict cos I was so fidgety, keep touching my face etc. But I have developed a technique to stop me being too fidgety. I also think DP has ADHD (doing the questionnaire for DD was when the penny dropped). The other day we were watching a (slightly tedious) school concert. He can't sit still- rocks around on his chair, wriggles, his legs are bouncing etc. I realised to all outward appearance I was sitting still - I cross my arms and legs to stop me fidgeting - but I am wriggling my toes like mad in my shoes...."
MaximilianNero,Sun 17-Jul-16 03:33:41,"I'm becoming convinced that I have ADHD as well as ASD. I did that test thing and got 6/6 and 9/12. This thread describes so much of what i experience.I have an addictive type personality...I can be completely obsesed with something, but then a switch will flip and suddenly I will completely lose all interest. I got to Candy Crush over level 1000 and then the switch flipped and I've had no desire to touch it since. If I want to stop something, it has to be cold turkey. To use the cigarette example, I am not one of those people who could cut from 20 to 15 to 10 a day and so on. It's cold turkey or nothing. I had to do that with the lottery most recently. No ability to stick to my spending limit. I constantly get hooked on researching or reading the next thing, and then move on. Never tried recreational drugs though, and never even had a cup of coffee because I hate the taste so much.I have 4 unfinished projects in my line of sight. No wait, 5Impulsive....very impulsive purchaser, cannot learn the lessons of previous stupidity. I know I should food shop on a full stomach. I KNOW I should. But I don't. Broken the law on impulse before and then thought 'oh you idiot, why'd you do that??'. Nearly get run over crossing the road because I won't wait for the green man. ""ooh, yes, I'll book flights to xyz for next week"". My pattern is always to impulsively book something and then have to frantically research to produce a tight plan to avoid extreme ASD anxiety. The sensible person would surely research first (sigh)Extremely restless and fidgety constantly. Often compelled to get up and start leaping around. Always put that solely down to ASD.Often miss part of people's sentences, cannot focus on what people are saying for long. Reread book sentences multiple times to take it in.Mind everywhere. Unless I'm obsessing on something, it's jumping from one thing to the next to the next. It's like something physically pulls my mind onto another focus, I have so little control over it  It's not necessarily any other particular thought either, it's maybe just nothing, I just slide out of focus so I'm staring at a wall with no concrete thoughts in my mind. It's this mind-everywhere and inability to concentrate that cause me difficulties work-wise. Coupled with indecision. For instance, I'm trying to choose a chocolate bar in Tesco. One of two bars. I will stand in that aisle for 10 or 15 entire minutes while I feel vaguely confused and my mind slides everywhere and then back to the chocolate bars but i have no idea which to have and can't squarely focus my mind on the bars for long, and rinse and repeat while I get more and more stressed out. Over a fecking chocolate bar.Mood swings all the time. Treated for depression before, but actually successfully, no longer clinically depressed, I just get sad mood swings. Very easily frustrated. I clean only in binges. Housework, cleaning and organisation are all or nothing events. Terrible at doing things that need doing, procrastinator extraordinaire, horrible organisation, require to-do lists to remember things, always misplacing my keys etc in my room and having to tip it upside down."
BertieBotts,Sun 24-Jul-16 20:04:29,"Interestingly the doctor who diagnosed me said she very much wanted to get me to do an intelligence test because she was very interested to see what it would say (she thinks I have very high intelligence) but the clinic didn't have the licence to one in English.I have never done a proper IQ test but I did once out of interest do an online sample quiz to join a MENSA organisation and got 98%.OMG, I could have written your post 3 years ago when I first found out about ADHD. Interestingly, though I had always thought of myself as prone to depression/suffering from depression multiple times since I was 14 (in hindsight, this was just when my ADHD started to seriously affect my life because it was when I first had to start being responsible for myself.) When I started psychotherapy/CBT my therapist asked me some questions about my depression and actually I don't, and have never, fitted the DSM criteria for it. That astounded me. Similarly for anxiety. The thing is that the feelings I've had which I always mistook for depression are feelings of despair at the way I can't seem to do things like other people do, that I have dreams and stuff but can't seem to get going on anything even when it's something I like, that I always self sabotage, that I genuinely forget things which are really important to me and feel like a horrible friend/person. The thing is in my case, these are proportionate reactions to situations which happened because of my ADHD, which I couldn't control. It wasn't that I felt like a useless person or a bad friend out of nowhere. I had evidence for these beliefs and they were (somewhat) rational.It is of note that since I have been taking this seriously and been diagnosed I have not lapsed into depression. For a really long time actually. I think it's because I can now put things into context and understand why they happen. I do still have days where I feel totally lost and like I'll never be able to do anything but then I think about what I've achieved with the problems I have and I remember that it's not so bad. I don't get stuck in it like I used to.They say that after diagnosis/discovery there is a period like grief with all of the different stages - anger, denial, depression, etc. And going through that stage of thinking of all the things you have missed out on is a hard one. I felt like writing to my college tutors to explain in case it helped them with a future student, but I decided not to in the end (not now, anyway). Being a part of the ADHD ""community"" has actually helped me to see things in a different way and a lot of the time I actually feel better about it now."

Left my EA husband and now trying to get a better career. Learned to drive before meds; meds help so much!

unlucky83,Wed 23-Nov-16 18:55:35,"I'm just reporting back on my assessment. The first appt I was gutted - he told me it sounded like normal difficulties etc and I could never have achieved what I have if I had it ...I had been trying to be calm and factual - like I said I didn't think it would be a battle. We seemed to be talking at cross purposes a lot - I was suicidally depressed in my 20s - he picked up I never attempted suicide I was never an inpatient - although my counsellor did ask me if I thought I needed to (I couldn't afford to!) etc etc. He definitely didn't think that I had been suicidal ...when I was (if that makes sense). Anyway my impulsive side came out and I went into a rant of how they missed DD1 until she 14 because she was bright - and just because I am bright so I have strategies etc so I am not in pieces doesn't mean I don't find things really really hard. And my mental health suffers cos I feel like a constant failure and am constantly forcing myself to be focused and in control etc etc. He said he'd see me again for a follow up...I left in a mess - pressed the self destruct button - and drove like a maniac home in tears -thinking I don't care any more - I need help and I'm not getting it.  Went back to the GP to tell her about it and she basically said maybe I had built it up too much in my head etc...go to the next appt viewing it as a clean slate.Next time I went with 2 A4 sides of my life history - started by apologising for being stroppy and went through everything I thought he'd misunderstood. Also he was worried about my mood -I was very low (not surprising I think...) - at the end he said it sounded like ADHD but he would have to have a chat with someone about me... So been back today ...really wound up about it - not sure how I would cope if it was a negative....anyway - drum roll- I now have an ADHD diagnosis. Will be starting meds after health checks - and actually don't know how I feel. I am exhausted. I feel happy - I guess relief that I am not just crap at life. But also sad about how much wasted ...everything ...where I would be if I had had a diagnosis as a child...how much easier things would have been. I am on the verge of tears ...not sure why - I think it is just relief... I know medication isn't a cure - but I am really hoping they help. (I'm quite excited about it - somewhere on a thread someone mentioned taking ecstasy - I took it twice in my 20s ( before I was physically ill and on serious medication that I couldn't mix with illegal drugs) For me it made everything so calm and clear, so peaceful - I'm hoping medication is a bit like that..."

GinnyLane,Sun 24-Apr-16 16:40:58,"Hi, very long-time lurker on MN, hope no-one minds... Signed up specifically to join the spoony thread as I really need to be a part of something right now, and I need to speak to/with people who understand. Diagnosis of ME/CFS - over a decade ago, with a recent serious relapse - and essentially signed off doctor's care (3rd opinion if that matters) with antiDs and OTC painkillers while waiting on neuro to 'double-check' that's all it is, due to family history.Saying 'all it is' feels like a joke though, woke up crying in pain and teary for most of the day. Migraine, vertigo and nausea naturally, took enough pills to take the edge off, but upset that I had to resort to that. Hate the numbness more than the pain... Can anyone else relate to that?

The numbness from antidepressants is what stopped me taking them (barr Amitryptilline for sleep) - I found it quite a wierd feeling and said to my GP that they made me feel not part of my family life as I just didn't feel part of everything and dare I say it, depressed.

MissSFatbum,Sun 13-Nov-11 17:40:32,"I'm so glad that others are having this problem!Ever since I started my periods when I was about 13, the bleeding was very heavy, very painful and very irregular. They put me on a mini pill for a few weeks which regulated me just fine. A few years later, I went on the combined pill because I also needed a contraceptive and it was spot on; no pregnancy, hardly any period pain and the periods were accurate to the hour and lasted about 5 days. Unfortunately, I got a blood clot after being on it a couple of years and (as it is one of the possible side effects) the doctors assumed it was because of the pill and not because I was a lazy bum who's idea of exercise was lifting the TV remote. I had to come off the pill but my periods remained pretty good (not too much pain, lasting about 7 days and always on time).Anyway, getting to the point.A year after the clot I got active, lost a lot of weight and went to the doctors for advice of a pill that comes with a reduced risk of thrombosis as i'm a bit mental and constantly need sex, but I don't constantly need the worry of a split condom etc. The doctor suggested Cerazette which I started on the 5th day of my period. That one finished fine, but when it came to the next month's one it was very painful and lasted about 15 days...very inconvenient! I started to get insane back aches, breast pain/swelling, head ache and the mood swings are ridiculous! ( I cried because a colleague offered to make me a coffee ) The second month made the symptoms worse, I was either super happy or stupidly depressed and, again, the period was really long and had a tendency to stop for a day and then start up again. It's my third month and I finished my period 5 days ago...today I came on yet again!  The pain is far worse than I remembered it to be last month and i've got a feeling that it'll just get worse rather than better, so i'm stopping this pill tonight. Quite frankly, i'd rather have to buy and use condoms again and run the risk of pregnancy than have this unpredictable bleeding that won't let up, feel as though my head is in a vice and be laughing one minute and crying the next.My whole reasoning for going on this pill was to have safer sex...now i'm lucky to have sex in general because i'm either bleeding (and having a mood swing over the thought of the mess it would make) or crying...neither of which are very sexy. No wonder it's such an effective contraception!To summarise: if Cerazette was a person, I would repeatedly punch it in the face."

Lottapianos,Wed 08-Feb-17 18:27:55,"OP, you sound so sad and lonely. I really feel for you. The amount of alcohol your man is drinking is not normal or ok and you know that.

As others have said, do not even consider trying to conceive with your relationship in this state. He's minimising the impact of the alcohol and trying to convince himself and you. I don't have any advice as such, just wanted to let you know that you are right to be concerned and that you are in no way to blame for this"
shouldihaveanotherbaby,Thu 05-Jan-17 12:37:59,"My DH doesn't really drink at home, but he drinks everyday at work. He works in quite a high pressure job which requires a lot of socialising but it turns out he also drinks during the day on his own. He came home at midnight last night after drinking by himself and admitted to me that he is an alcoholic but doesn't feel that he can do his job properly without a few drinks. He is still in bed today and says he feels a bit depressed. I have tried not to push him and suggested that we will figure something out when he feels up to talking about it, but I have a feeling that he doesn't think anyone/anything will help. (He saw a counsellor before a few times but thought she was useless).I can't talk to anyone (friends or family) for fear of them judging him. I don't know what (if any) action to take or how to go about it. I feel like I am walking on thin ice with him on this issue.....Any words of wisdom out there?"
shouldihaveanotherbaby,Fri 06-Jan-17 19:56:19,"Thank you for your advice. I'd not ever thought that I might be 'enabling' him. He seems depressed and spent most of yesterday asleep. He has suffered from depression and panic attacks in the past so I wonder if he treats the depression with drink or if the drink causes the depression. Or maybe both!I have told him that he needs to seek help but I am drip feeding the suggestions, otherwise he will just put the shutters down. He knows he needs help and that is a big step in itself.I will def call that helpline and see what they suggest."
Linds53,Fri 06-Jan-17 20:35:33," He will seem depressed and will spend a lot of time sleeping. Alcoholism does that to a person. There's no point wondering which came first, because the fact is that alcohol is now the problem. His doctor can't/won't treat him for depression while he's abusing alcohol. Knowing he needs help isn't necessarily a big step. My husband in his rare sober moments realised he had a problem. When he was dying he told me it was 'self-inflicted injury'. Action is the only thing which will make a difference and the decision to act must come from him. Anything you say to him while he is drunk/needing a drink is wasted breath. He won't be listening. I'm sorry if that seems harsh. I have so much sympathy for you. It is hell, but the important thing to remember is that whatever happens you don't need to be pulled down with him."
BottomlyP0tts,Sat 25-Feb-17 08:59:29,I'm not sure what to do - my partner drinks every night I would say at a minimum 3 cans of beer but normally more like 6. Any chance he has to drink during the day he takes (never at work though - I know this for a fact) he doesn't have anything else doesn't hide his drinking doesn't get grumpy is very kind and gentle however he does get depressed and stressed very easily. It just seems like it's this constant thing. We are quite young have 2DC one on the way and we really can't afford that amount of booze each week. He has made a few attempts at only drinking on the weekends etcBasically a really nice man who gets depressed and always has a beer near him... I am not a drinker at all
Prochaska,Fri 03-Feb-17 10:12:52,"Deep breath.I stumbled upon the soberistas webchat and something has clicked for me... but I'm kind of nervous.I know I'm sick of hangovers. In fact I'm sick and tired of feeling sick and tired.My eyes are always bloodshot. I never have any energy, and haven't for years. I'm overweight. I'm anxious, sometimes depressed. I'm so overwhelmed by things that need doing to run our home, and I'm putting jobs off thinking, I'll do that when I get a non-hangover day, but that never comes.I'm losing weekends to hangovers, and that's shit for my kids.Last week I lost actual stuff - keys, bag, purse and in my head I'm not the person that does that. Other people get drunk and lose stuff but I don't. But I did. Ugh. I put last week's units into an app and I'm shocked to see it was 80plus. Horrific. That was with two big celebrations but could also just have easily been an ordinary week where we go for boozy lunches and carry on. I don't want to feel like this any more.BUT.I'm dreading my DH's reaction. He's going to take it personally. That I won't be his drinking buddy. That we won't get pissed together, have a cuddle and watch Netflix. He'll say, 'but you need it in social situations. You hate being sober on a night out.' I'm worried he'll think I'm boring. He thinks our booze in take is fine because lots of our friends drink more and get in worse states.I'm worried my friends will think I'm rejecting them. That I'll be flat and tense on nights out. I don't want to drink this weekend, but we have a night out in honour of a friend. It will be so obvious if I don't drink, people will ask if I'm pregnant or something. I'll be embarrassed. I'm socially anxious and without a loosener I freeze a bit. I need to find other ways of dealing with my anxiety, because I'm killing my self in a bid to numb myself. Agh. Any advice please? From anyone who is at, or has been at, this first stage of thinking about it?"

pipppopin,Wed 17-Aug-16 16:08:04,"I was the same. 1 bottle of wine a night easily, more at the weekends. Moody, depressed, overweight. Thought about alcoholism with fear & confusion constantly. Finally went to AA meetings for 1 year, educated myself about booze, met a lot of people, heard a lot of stories, really started to understand my relationship with alcohol. That was 6 years ago & I remain sober & in a very good place emotionally. Don't think about booze from one end of the year to the next. My mood is on an even keel & I wake up knowing that whatever I feel is authentic - not manipulated by the high & lows of heavy drinking. I don't believe that I have the disease of alcoholism but it took going into AA and following their programme solidly to come to that conclusion & manage my sobriety independently. I spend most of my time overseas & when I return to the UK i am struck by the national obsession with booze It is everywhere & constant social drinking has been normalised. I recently joined an online dating site & noticed that 90% of UK female profile photos feature a glass of wine! What is that all about??? "

tallie82,Mon 18-Jul-16 07:33:12," I have always liked drinking and have suffered with depression my whole life. 8 weeks ago my husband after years of manipulating and emotionally abusing me threatened to kill me and shoved me I tp a door so I had him arrested. This has left me alone with 2 Yong children (4&10m) and I a struggling to cope. I was drinking before he left and had several episodes as I Call them where I'd drink, go out and try (and sometimes succeed) to getting high on cocaine which caused massive strain on our relationship and I now feel this is all my fault. This weekend o have so e it all again, drank, some drugs, went back to some guys house and there was kissing etc (no sex thankfully) so I feel horribly guilty that I've cheated on my husband and he will never forgive me. He seems to be doing so well, seeing the kids at the weekend and working hard while I'm falling apart. He never gave a crap about the Kida when he was here so I think he has now realized what he done and wants to make amends. I still love him and want to try and work things out bit we can't talk as he is out bail and the conditions are no contact with me until the court case in September. I have bewwn to the doctors so many times but am going again today as I feel suicidal. I know this is all down to alcohol but I've tries to stop and I can't. I'm destroying y life, I feel so awful I can't look at my kids without crying and I just hate myself so much I self harmed at the weekend 2. Everything is such a Mess, my parents are very supportive but are at their witts end with me and so am I. I hate what I've become, o am like a different person hen I drink. I know some of it is to do with the medication I take for depression as it can make me hyper so I drink. I'm trying to come off them so I can go on something else . Sorry of this sound all over the place I'm just trying to get it all down. None of this is done around my kids although i have drank when they are up. I feel so low and hopeless I just want to end it all to stop the cycle. The only thing that stops me is my kids."
NotNob,Wed 20-Jul-16 12:19:46, Would you consider calling the AA helpline? They will help you. I was terribly depressed until I stopped drinking.
Tippytoes13,Fri 15-Jul-16 21:54:04,"Hi, I'm really looking for some advice if possible. My husband has been drinking heavily for about six months now, the most he drinks is on a Friday and that can be anything up to 12 cans of beer. He runs his own business and I suspect he's depressed as he's showing signs of that too, he often falls asleep on the sofa after drinking and gets up 20 minutes before he has to go to work, I sort the kids out every morning all by myself and I'm getting exhausted. He is becoming agitated with me too, he's not very supportive either and I just can't cope with him.Any advice on what I can do, would be highly appreciated.Thank you!"
IHaveTheLurgy,Sat 27-Feb-16 08:39:48,"As background, I started drinking heavily at 14. Through 14-15 I would drink most nights, often alone. Small bottles of spirits in a night and that horrible strong cider. I cut right back until about 18-19 when I was out clubbing 5 nights a week and drinking an unbelievable amount. Continued to get very drunk at least three times a week all through my 20s. Calmed down in my thirties, only really drinking at home one night a week. I have a young DD. I sometimes have a few drinks at home once she's in bed. I often find that after one or two drinks I want more, want to get more drunk. I would never go out to buy more and I don't have loads at home so it's not an issue of me getting carried away and not being able to stop. I have always suffered from anxiety and depression, I remember feeling depressed in junior school. I love the happy, lightheaded feeling of being tipsy but know it always comes with the price of feeling beyond low the next day. Anxiety through the roof and horrible depressive thoughts. I get so stressed and I'm irritable. Even after one glass of wine I'm horrible to be around the next day. It has a knock on effect to our DD, I am much less able to cope with her and I'm grumpy with her. At the weekend I went out for the first time in about 6 years and got properly wasted. The next day was so so awful. Mentally. I felt like I'd never recover. I've been having panic attacks since. I said stuff I shouldn't and having massive guilt, questioning everything, feeling like it's the end of the world. I don't have any local friends and whenever I feel like I'm about to make one I pull back because I know they're going to suggest going out for drinks and I just don't want to be around it. I feel like I'm the odd one out, socially. No one else is like this. I'm a pariah. Sorry, this is more of a rant and just getting it out. I think I've answered my own question."
MummyHappy73,Tue 10-May-16 10:34:29,Hello Mummies and DaddiesDoes anybody else struggle with wine?

magnificatAnimaMea,Sun 15-Nov-15 19:35:23,"A friend has had serious alcohol issues in the past - including time in rehab and in the local hospital's psychiatric ward with severe depression, suicidal ideation, etc. In many aspects her life is ""back on track"", but she has continued to drink at a very low level, and the level has been creeping up in the last few months to the point that people are beginning to notice.We all live in a small town; the old friends she has know her history intimately and know the reasons she may once again be struggling. But anyone who has attempted to discuss it with her has been cut off from ""good"" friend to ""superficial social politeness"" friend - and she is gradually becoming isolated in that group. She does seem to have friends at work, all of whom would see people with addiction problems regularly and thus would realise what the problem is, but I don't think she socializes with them much.She is in danger of losing her job, which is the central element of her successfully rebuilding herself and her life. Her profession has a one-strike-and-you're-out policy. She knows this, but is drinking at a level where her blood alcohol might be over the limit the morning after the night before.Is there any way any of us can broach this without simply getting cut off? i am as close as anyone to her - I tried to talk to her nearly a year ago, and it did seem to work for a while, but she had less to worry about then, than she does now.I know she needs help from AA. I know she needs to choose to ask for help. But part of her problem is probably that she feels isolated, while isolating herself. Somehow we need to make her feel less isolated."
PositivePete,Wed 30-Dec-15 14:31:32,"I plan from now. It has stop.My DM has zero tolerance of sympathy also.I don't like the sound of AA as I'd be at every meeting my DM was at!?!? As you say thou, being upfront about it is maybe the best start for me.I told a friend yesterday (sadly after reading the replies on here) I realised that I am surrounded by drinkers, surrounded by people who actually get pissed all the time. The friend I told said (who drinks) but is not a heavy drinker & also supportive remarked I should actually look at my friend group!!It has to stop I can't go on like this. My mood is diabolical today (depressed) due to excess yesterday & I think I pissed a friend off who prob will fall by the way side now. I can't let this happen again.It starts today, not 1 Jan. TODAY.I am looking into the book that was recommended - thank you & I am going to see if I can get some counselling via private health care at work.Thanks for listening all.

Niori,Wed 13-May-15 19:20:35,"Hi RainbowUntil July last year, I'd crept up from drinking a couple of glasses a week over a number of years to a full wine box a night. I tried to stop on my own - I couldn't.Alcoholism is an illness, and it's progressive. An alcoholics body doesn't deal with booze in the same way as a non alcoholics. Drinking causes us to crave more...hence why I could never stop at 'just one or two'. once I started, I had to continue, and one or two turned into 3-4 bottles a night without me ever really wanting to drink that. The only treatment for that physical craving is abstinence. However if you are an alcoholic, putting the drink down isn't enough, because we're not only physically hooked, we're mentally obsessed too. As to the reasons why I drank, it became the only time that I ever felt good in my own skin. Without drink, I was absolutely miserable, so even when I did manage to not drink I wasn't doing well mentally or emotionally. I was angry, anxious, depressed.I never drank to get drunk, I drank to feel ok.I joined AA a little over ten months ago, and I haven't had a drink since. It saved my life. I'm doing well now, ended a bad marriage with a 'feeder' type, started to get my home life in a place where it should be, because make no mistake, this is very hard on children as we don't function as we should. On the hunt for a job at the moment and have picked up hobbys again that I left behind a long time ago. Life after booze doesn't have to be doom and gloom, we just have to work on what makes us pick up that drink in the first place  I have a far better quality of life in sobriety than I ever had before it......a year ago, I couldn't imagine life without booze and now I feel like a totally different woman. There is a way out, I promise.Best wishes"
Whatamuckingfuddle,Tue 11-Aug-15 08:01:52," I have a problem with binge drinking. I don't do it very often but when I do I go way over the top and end up depressed for days/weeks afterwards. I appear to have no control at all once I've had a couple of drinks and refuse to stop. I'd love to have a social drink but once I've had glass or two, it's like I have to be drunk, it's embarrassing and I don't know how to deal withit, apart from going teetotal which is fine but I'd love a glass every now and then without ruining the next week or two of my life, does anyone have any idea of what I talking about and any suggestions on how to deal with my behaviour?"
AWholeLottaNosy,Tue 16-Dec-14 17:00:26, I'm drinking a bottle of wine a night at the moment. Mainly because I'm on my own and I feel lonely depressed and sad.
ninawish,Wed 17-Dec-14 08:49:59,Oh and issues. 3 months later I'm much happier I was depressed before and I'm now 90% sure the alcohol was working as a depressant.

Since the first 10 days or so I've had a few very blue days but that's it
AWholeLottaNosy,Thu 18-Dec-14 17:52:16,"So today I did a cost/benefit analysis of my drinking.

Ok I might feel warm, confident and happy for half an hour but I always end up feeling ill, depressed and self hating. I do like pubs but that's only cos everyone else there is drinking so it seems 'normalised' IYSWIM. I AM NOT DRINKING TODAY."
Linds53,Sun 10-May-15 01:08:35," Yes we had kids and it was horrendous for them, watching the dad they loved destroyed by drink. It took me a long time to figure out that he had a drink problem. I thought he was seriously depressed and made all kinds of allowances. But he became unreliable, aggressive and frightening and I allowed it to continue for far too long as I was desperate to repair him and hold our family together. It was only when I got in touch with alanon that I realised I was enabling him by making excuses for his behaviour and protecting him from the consequences of his actions. Now he has gone I can see all the mistakes I made but at the time I was just so anxious for our lives to return to 'normal'. It was only when he became violent that we separated. To be honest Dexter, my kids didn't cope. They really suffered. My husband was unrecognisable by the end. He looked like a man in his eighties and he had basically lost his mind. Cirrhosis is a horrible way to die."
Niori,Sat 16-May-15 19:18:59,"Hi LazyminimooI can totally relate to what you're saying. I became agoraphobic in the end, and just wasn't functioning at all. I was suicidal, and at the end of my rope with it all.I eventually made it to an AA meeting, got a sponsor and I work the steps, and I haven't looked back since. I can go anywhere, my social anxiety is vastly improved, to the point where I start a little voluntary job on monday....and I'm actively seeking paid work too.When I just stopped drinking, it was hell on earth. I felt even more miserable and worthless.I was absolutely petrified at my first AA meeting, but I had no need to be. Most, if not all, understand the place where you are at right now, and we all know how scary that first meeting is.Someone earlier posted the helpline number. In my area at least, a 12th stepper will usually accompany you to a first meeting if you feel that would help.The help is there, you just have to reach out and take it. Best wishes x"

Alsoflamingo,Mon 08-Dec-14 11:49:09,"What a brilliant, positive take on this time of year, NoLonger. I like it! Will try to keep that in mind as I embark on a week of non-stop parties. Hope I encounter a good selection of non-alcoholic options as they are generally pretty dull (if offered at all). I am coming up for 3 years sober and agree with Alfie about the hardest bit being feeling self-conscious about ordering a soft drink - rather than not drinking - if that makes sense. I plan on allowing myself to indulge my excessive side on chocolate so I don't feel deprived. Although as time goes on I don't really feel deprived - deprived of what? Rotten hangovers, shame, puffy face, red eyes etc….Good luck to everyone approaching a sober Christmas. For anyone in London, there are all day AA meetings which you can drop into whenever if you are feeling shaky 'on the day'. I found that really helpful my first year (pretended I was dropping a present round with a God-child and escaped for an hour)."
JustTryEverything,Sun 14-Dec-14 08:11:27,"Hi everyone - Christmas number 2 here and my word the change in my life, in me is absolutely worth every minute of anxiety and stress over my 1st sober Christmas last year. It really is just another day, one more 24 hour reprieve from my disease - and what an amazing 24 hours they will be. My DS is 2.5 and I have a newborn so will be able to manage the early wake up with excitement, enthusiasm and selflessness instead of sickness, despair and resentment.I will be able to focus on my family, my brother and his new wife, my parents - instead of obsessing about how I can force my will on the situation to get another drink.As the day goes on, I will be present, available and considerate of everyone there - instead of slowly descending into a self pitying, selfish and irresponsible liability.All of these things remind me why that just one drink is not an option for me and have made it incredibly easy as my sobriety increases to feel comfortable about not drinking alcohol and able to thoroughly enjoy social situations without alcohol.That said, I do consider invitations carefully - if a party or other gathering involves mostly people you don't get on with that well (and would therefore usually need alcohol to hide behind), then be kind to yourself and put your sobriety first by politely declining. If you really have to go, then as pp have said, make sure you are able to leave at any time should you feel uncomfortable or wobbly in any way.It's completely true that most other people do not care whether you are drinking or not - it's only our own warped obsession with alcohol and how much or what everyone else us drinking that is part of this disease. As others have said (sorry can't see on the app to name check) a breezy order for a soft drink rather tHan a stuttering apology and lots of excuses is the way forward.AA saved my life but sharing in other ways outside of meetings is what I need to work on so I am really pleased to have found this topic, found this thread and found all you lovely sober people!Have a great day everyone."

I don't normally do that much in one sitting by the way (she says pathetically ). Lostit, cocaine DOES rewire your brain apparently. Something about finding it difficult to experience pleasure from other things and having very little ability to delay gratification, hence the tunnel vision and thinking we are invincible and won't get a comedown this time. There has been compelling evidence that an amino acid called NAC if taken over a month can repair some of that damage and help significantly with cravings. I have been taking it for just over a week and not noticed a difference, but will let you all know."

franckiesmum,Wed 14-Dec-16 14:34:31,"My friend is an alcoholic. She accepts she ""drinks too much"" but would never categorise herself as an addict. Last night, she telephoned me and was in such an emotional state that I was terrified for her. She was threatening suicide, screaming at me, showing signs of paranoia, suffering memory loss, sobbing her heart out - completely the opposite to the person I know.She eventually calmed down enough to tell me she had been arrested, locked up and charged with drink driving but she had done nothing wrong. She said the police just turned up at her door and in a threatening way, said they would ""get her"" and smash her door in to get to her.I tried to talk her through it until she became calmer then asked her permission to try and get someone to help her. I called the A&E unit to ask where I could go for help. They referred me to the critical Illness psychiatric unit who said if she was suicidal, the safest way for her was to call the police. As it seemed that the police issue was the one frightening her the most, I asked her for her husbands number so I could speak to him. He works at the other end of the country and was away.When I spoke to him, it turns out she is banned from all the pubs in the area, she is prohibited from leaving the house between certain hours, she can't wander the streets unaccompanied. She already has a criminal record for slapping a police officer when drunk. She is banned from calling the emergency services. I'm her friend and didn't know any of this. Her son doesn't even know.Her husband has paid for private clinics, alcoholic counselling, psychiatric care etc. but she just walks away and says they don't help her. She has threatened suicide before and he's driven the 5 hours it takes him to get from his job to find her dramatising a suicide situation only for the ambulance services to say she hasn't actually taken anything but is just making a cry for help.She is grieving for her father who sadly passed away a year ago. She is also grieving the death of her beloved dog. Her husband works away and all her friends have deserted her. Her son really doesn't want to know because he is ashamed of how she acts in drink. She lost her job 7 years ago again through drink and has basically lost all her self-esteem.This is a normal, homely, comfortable woman who on the surface shouldn't have a care in the world and should be able to grieve privately for her losses. Instead, she's throwing away all help and throwing away her life in the process.All she is worried about is the effect it will have on her if (when) she loses her licence, what her son will think of her. She is going to try and keep it away from him but I don't know how long it will take him to work out the fact she isn't driving.I'm really worried. My daughter says all I can do is be there for her to talk to and help her reflect on all the good times and memories we had growing up but talk of suicide makes me really frightened for her.I am sure her husband has looked at all the options for her but I really want to do something that will make a difference. I would welcome some direction from anyone familiar with this type of situation. Thank you."
wonkylampshade,Sat 07-May-16 09:05:51,"I've pm'd you some old emails I wrote when I was lurching from hope to despair and back again...hopefully they're useful but reading over them again really reminds me that it wasn't a linear progression, to get away from him and out of the situation. It's cathartic reading through it but also scary...it was such a fucked up situation and I tried everything I could think of to fix it, to the point where I just lost all hope and it nearly broke me.I can still remember the physical sense of relief and absolute peace the day I knew there was no going back."
MrsMargoLeadbetter,Wed 29-Jun-16 20:09:03,"Difficult day here. Had a nice day out with DD but was so focused on size, it took the shine off. Also she was looking with such love and admiration at me, but all I could think was about negative size related thoughts. Food has been ok. I didn't eat breakfast early enough I think too which probably didn't help. I also didn't snack in time as I felt self-conscious about eating in public/being overweight and daring to eat!Really tired. Going to go to bed soon and hopefully tomorrow will be a brighter day!"
BursarsFrogs,Tue 12-Jul-16 08:56:41,"Morning everyone. I've been reading Overcoming Binge Eating, and have mixed feelings about it. A lot of the things don't really ""fit"" for me somehow. I'm also disappointed that it (like most other books) says you can't think about losing weight while tackling the ED. I actually kind of realised that if I'm totally honest, the main reason I want to tackle my ED is so that I could lose weight - not so I could just be healthier etc.  Not thinking about my weight is also sadly not really an option... I get weighed a lot in hospitals and I'm pre-diabetic, and can also access fertility treatments as long as my BMI is under a certain limit. I'm starting to think this round of IVF hasn't worked. Still a few days till I'll know for sure though. We still have a couple of embryos in the freezer, but if we're to need another fresh cycle I'm seriously going to need to crash diet, as bad as I know it will be for me. I'm having a really shit morning really. I feel fat, hormonal, depressed and ashamed of everything about myself. It all definitely makes me want to binge. But I've had a normal filling breakfast and I'm trying to just get on with things."
BursarsFrogs,Mon 18-Jul-16 21:27:21,"Thank you Margo. We have three embryos left in the freezer, and we should be able to go ahead for a transfer with them in a few months' time, all being well. If that doesn't work we'll need to move to a new fresh cycle (we have one NHS funded left still), and it's before that that I'd need to lose some weight. I'm not enjoying the hot weather. I'm too self-conscious to wear summery clothes, but at least I didn't wear a jacket today! Had a loose short sleaved shirt on that was fairly cooled and covered my upper arms and my bum. I know it doesn't make me look any less fat, but it feels less revealing. I've decided to give the self help plan in Overcoming Binge Eating a go, so I'm keeping the recommended food diary. I did have a binge today, and writing down what I ate wasn't exactly fun. I managed by promising myself I don't have to show it to anyone!I hope you're all managing to keep cool and enjoy the summer while it lasts."
ChanceBeAFineThing,Tue 11-Oct-16 19:58:37,"I'm still here. Still flirting between coping and not. Caught myself starting to binge and stopped it in progress. A bit bummed out that I started, but going to try and focus on the positive. New and Maggie I also struggle with apps. I like to know what's a normal or appropriate portion size, and watch what I'm eating (because I think I'm subconsciously trying to lose weight still). I also want to not use them and sometimes don't. I try and listen to my body and how hungry it is, and not get depressed if I've eaten a bit much at the weekend, say. I don't want to go too far. I recognise obsessive behaviours in them, but want to check what's an appropriate amount IYSWIM? It's all a bit hit and miss with them at the moment. Overall, I guess I'm ok. I think for me to be ""fixed"" is the process of learning how to live with my continual thoughts and obsessions about food. I don't think they'll ever go away, I just need to be able to manage them? Or do they go away? Hmmmmm."
MrsMargoLeadbetter,Tue 18-Oct-16 00:01:18,"HelloSorry for not posting. I was waiting for the ""perfect"" time to post, which never came! And once it dropped off my 'Threads I am on' it seemed like a big jump to post. So glad to hear the studies have started fighting. Such an amazing step. Well done for talking about the ED too. Has anyone brought it up again?Hope the move went ok Newyear?I am not sure calorie counting will ever work for ""us"", as the fact we are doing it hints at trying to control I guess? Which probably means restrict?Well done on going to the Dr's Maggie, sorry to hear about the anaemia. Hope the tablets help soon. I am slightly too, I wonder if there is a link between EDs and anaemia.Had a really busy period with work - worked everyday for 3 weeks. Eating wasn't too bad but I did virtually no exercise which isn't good for my mental health. I keep having moments of despair where I wish I could be thinner. I feel really lost as to how I should ""be"" now re food/feelings around food. I am struggling to let go of becoming smaller thoughts. However, the rational part of me knows that my self-esteem is the real issue and not the food or my body. Might try a counsellor for that. Was also toying with the idea of a stylist, there is a local one who is fairly affordable, as I am just so depressed having to order large 'cover up' clothes but I am just not sure I can hold it together to talk through clothes /body shape feeling as I do. And she isn't expecting to offer counselling as well as style advice!!I also keep having flash backs to having PND, not sure I am completely over it. On a more positive note I am enjoying this woman's podcasts - www.lifeunrestricted.org/ She was a national radio host in Switzerland but has turned her back on that is now a body positive person. She is a nice change from the American podcasters that are all a bit OTT.How is everyone doing? Any plans for half-term if yours is coming up?"

It's terrible, I come downstairs and all I can think about is what can I stuff my face with... It's making me depressed that I don't seem to be able to control these urges. The very few days here and there that I've managed to get decent sleep I'm so full energy and determination, exercising and eating salads and then the next day after a bad night of sleeping only 3 hours I sit on the sofa eating cake all day!

On reflection I think I was depressed. I also drank heavily and took recreational drugs. Have you considered contacting the Eating Disorder's Association for advice? I got better when I got happy, which in my case was meeting my lovely DP who loved me unconditionally. Hopefully someone else will be ofMore help. "
IamAporcupine,Mon 11-Jul-16 21:54:19,"thanks everyoneMellifera no, he's never had therapy and I know he will never ever accept it. I am sure he is quite familiar with schema therapy as he is a therapist himself .... AnchorDownDeepBreath I am angry for different reasons, but definitely not for the relapse itself. the short answer would be I am angry because he can't talk to me. but I am also angry because I do everything to try to accommodate his needs so that he can be more in control. we eat different food, we usually do not eat together, we can hardly eat out, we can't go to friends' meals, we spend very little time together because his exercise is first etc etc etc. yet I feel if I was to bring it up I'd be told to fuck off and stop imagining things like he did last time. he is grumpy and difficult most of the time and I do not know if I can cope anymore. I love him but he's become so distant...I do not think it will trigger my own issues. I have been trying to lose weight and get back in shape for ages, but I am so fucking depressed I can't even do that. thanks for caring It's a good suggestion, but I do not think I could take control of his food.DavidPuddy I totally understand how difficult it is and I would never push him or judge him. As I said, I just wished he would reach to me "
kate60,Wed 17-Feb-16 17:02:03,Does anyone by any chance know of a good and kind dietician in Edinburgh? My daughter was very poorly with anorexia and she is now mentally much better but needs help and support with getting her weight up. She is up at Edinburgh university and a long way from home but determined to manage. The university has been hopeless with no support at all. Lots of thanks
RegentsParkWolf,Mon 20-Jun-16 20:24:25," Sorry to hear that frogs. I haven't got any further with DD. She has been to see the dr about her insomnia and dr has changed her to a different antidepressant. I'm concerned as the one she was on did seem to help her mood and I think her insomnia is really down to not having a routine - she sleeps all day and is up all night but I'm not sure she explained that to dr, just said she couldn't get to sleep. The new antidepressant is known for causing weight gain. I think the dr probably thought that would be helpful as DD is very underweight but I think it will make the bulimia worse. I don't think DD would have told the dr about the bulimia. On the plus side, DD felt the dr had listened to her instead of talking down to her and she has made another appointment so I'm hoping if she feels she can trust the dr she might open up about the bulimia. Trouble is, I don't think she wants to get better - I think she likes to be able to eat lots but stay thin. I feel a bit hopeless to be honest. Hope your DD gets through the A levels. If the bulimia is a response to stress maybe it will settle when the stress is less?"
jassS,Fri 17-Apr-15 07:53:27,"Welcome, mydear. and belive me - we all have been where tou are. Sometimes we still are there and we all know we will sometimes also in the future be back on square one. But it does not mean that the situation is hopeless. Most of us feel that the binge-diet cycle fades once you decide the following:- stop thinking ""I only eat today/this week, then will properly get myself in hand and lose weight""- stop restricting- stop reacting to a binge by trying to ""compensate"" next day for it. Your weight will still somewhat fluctuate, but sooner or later it settles. Some of us can say it was rising through all diet-binge cycles over 10-20 years. And it stabilised quite quickly when diet-binge cycle was broken. Not completely broken, I repeat, bingeing or at least overeating still happens occasionally. Important thing is, it does not matter. Also healthy ppl sometimes eat toomuch, they just donot think abou it too much after the event and go on living. For us overeating means ""fail"" and fail means urge to punish, compensate, but bfore compensation comes the feeling ""at least I will eat before i diet, since my day/week is anyway ruined"". It takes at least a year for the body to believe you truly are not going to put it back on diet. And it only believes if you make sure you eat three proper meals a day, maybe some snacks, and do not calorie count. Of course make sure you get nutritious food, concentrate on what you get positive from food - eat a lot of vegs and fruit and meat and fish and eggs and all healthy stuff, but do not forbid unhealthy things. Focus on getting good things in first, in quantities you like, do not try to keep to a certain decent portion size. Eating too little that lunctime hot meal means for sure you want something probably not so useful, but handy, before evening meal. For urgencies, keep fruit or other stuff you like and is easy to eat guilt-free handy. I think this is the essence of what has started to kill the binge-bust cycle for me. Good luck! Off to my next flight now, so far the apple and latte i had is sustaining me:-)))"
FightingBed2014,Mon 20-Apr-15 14:48:05,"Lou it sounds like the holiday gave you space to try changes, it sounds like it suits you well. You should be proud of yourself, that is quite a corner you have turned.  I am struggling wih the eating something sweet at the end of my meal again. Thanks for the advice there sleep, I will follow that.my eating has been a bit wobbly of late. As life has been unsettled I have been over eating. not enough to say binges, for me but more than I need. I know why and I tonk because I have been tackling the emotions the food hasn't been full blown binges but enough to comfort. I finally feel as though I am coming out the other side now. The weight gain isn't really bothering me, no plans to restrict etc. (Although now I don't feel depressed I am getting much more excercise in, DH looked a little tired this morning )."
jassS,Mon 27-Apr-15 21:40:29," read your blog now Fighting. I try to overcome my fear of summer clothing by saying that elderly people always also look invariably horrible with skin showing, but that is what life is. Only tiny proportion of ppl look good in revealing clothes, majority do not and since I am seriously middle-aged it is time to start forgetting about the looks. I even try to go without make -up nowadays to show myself that my colleagues do not think I am weird if I do. They do not give a damn, I can see. But of course the good thoughts somerimes give way to the despair I am not what I was say 10 years ago. Is it weight- related or just normal sadness for youth gone? I have BEF, so I make it a weight issue, maybe someone else will have it as wrinkles issue instead? No idea...."
dajmibuzi,Sat 16-May-15 04:42:04,"Hi elfinI can help you somewhat re antidepressants. I take sertraline at the moment as a precautionary measure to avoid getting post natal depression after dd. I had it horrendous after ds 3 years ago. I really rate them as I've been on a few and they've got me out of a really dark place but efficacy can really differ from person to person. From my observations of people on MN and in RL it's that it very much depends on your starting point. Say, for me, they help me function and lead a pretty normal life free from extremely unhealthy behaviour and suicidal thoughts but I find they don't do much for the binge eating because that isn't one of my worst/most severe symptoms of depression. if this is how I naturally felt and was my natural starting point then they might have had a fighting chance at tackling my eating disorders throughout my life. They may really help you. And are probably worth a shot. I am bias though because they are a life saver for me and I have never felt shame in needing them to help me live a normal life.I had a good run for about 5 years of healthy eating habits. Not that I ate particularly healthily but my attitude towards food was not one that tormented me constantly like it does at the moment. I feel pretty optimistic about beating it though and like mrsmargo has stated it's probably not about the fact you have tempting food available to you it's that you haven't found a way to help you manage the emotions that lead you to binge. But you will! Would you be open to trying antidepressant and/or talking therapy?"
runningLou,Sun 17-May-15 07:01:10,"I am just so, so depressed. I woke up this morning after going to bed at 9:30pm last night and just looked at this fat, puffy, larva-like face in the mirror and I hate myself. I really cannot work out what to do. Since last Sunday I have not binged. I have been eating healthy foods, including proteins and good fats (cashew nuts, greek yogurt), 3 meals a day, generally not snacks as no time/not hungry. And I have gained weight. Again. And it's not just a number on the scales as my clothes feel tighter. This gain just feels inexorable. I am trying to stop the mindset that says ""whatever you eat you just gain weight so it doesn't matter what you do, stop trying to eat healthy and just pig out"". This is very, very tempting but I am trying not to listen as I know ultimately I will feel worse.But why am I still gaining?! Maybe my sense of portion size is utterly messed up? I don't have anyone to compare with other than DH (average weight) and I do eat less than him. Last night I had 2 helpings of dessert but it was fruit salad FFS!!!! I made a big fruit salad at lunchtime as I always feel cheated if there's no pudding on Saturdays so I wanted there to be something. DH ate chocolate biscuits surreptitiously by the kitchen counter as he knows they are a trigger for me. I feel like if I am eating healthily, I should surely be seeing some kind of pay-off in terms of weight loss/stabilisation? What the hell am I doing wrong?? I am so, so ready to start juicing tomorrow, as I know it will make the numbers on the scale go down. But then, I know it will also trigger a binge at the end of the week when I can't take it any more, so I won't do it. But I need to have some kind of reinforcement that I am doing the right thing. At the moment my weight is not changing and I feel if anything even lower than before. I think this way of eating evens out the highs and lows of restricting and bingeing - both of which have their highs. And I miss that. I am exhausted, snappy, irritable, feel unproductive. I have been back to the gym this week - easing into it after op. But I went twice in the week and also went for a run. And that had no impact either. I want to call in sick for work tomorrow and curl up and die."
FightingBed2014,Fri 22-May-15 20:54:27,"Elfin,your descriptions sound very much how I was when I first on this journey. I did manage to find other things that replaced that buzz I could only get with food. Before that I was certainly depressed and unhappy with my life at the time, although I couldn't actually identify those emotions, I just couldn't control how much I ate or thought about it excitedly. It took a lot of digging to find those issues but it eventually broke the cycle and I don't have those same emotions now. Sure I still have a bad relationship with food but it's changed.You're comment regarding will power struck me. If we simply reduce BED to a test of willpower, I think the only option it leaves is for us to permenantly feel defeated and doesn't acknowledge the overwhelming effects it has on us and our thought process. You are not a failure and disordered eating doesn't define who you are. There are things you can find you enjoy and will genuinely make you happy, for now food is faking that role but it is within you to get past that, think back through your life and there will be something you could try again even from a childhood memory or a longing for something once. I appreciate Depression can mask the energy to get out there and participate in life. If its too much right now, use the web. I recently discovered a love of reading novels and it takes me away from the constant meh, to a place without sadness. The other thing I do is cape, it gives me a stimulus and flavour but no food, it has been a help for me.x"
IronMaggie,Sat 06-Jun-15 09:49:39,"For those struggling with snacking, I think it's worth deciding beforehand how much you're going to eat, and what portion size you need. Elfin could you put a couple of squares (or however much you think would be a reasonable serving) of your lovely chocolate in a nice bowl, rather than taking it straight from the bar? Easier said than done, I realise.I went full on 'Paleo' for a few months last year (apart from binges of course), and yep, I also bought a food processor and started making weird versions of all the things I really wanted to eat. I actually don't think it's a bad idea in moderation - lots of veggies, fruit, meat, eggs, nuts. But my focus at the moment is on not restricting at all, so will concentrate on that for now.Fighting - glad things are going well. And such a good point about the photos. I had to have some taken for work last week, and had a bit of an epiphany. Normally I despise photos of myself and wish I looked different / better in them, but I had much less anxiety as I think I'm coming to terms with the fact that that's just what I look like. Hard to explain, but I'm pleased I didn't spiral into a depressed funk like I normally would. Maybe this is what becoming a grown up feels like!? Cassie, how are you getting on with the dancing? I had a look at that video you posted to and it looked super intense, I might have to give it a go!"
Firsttimer7259,Thu 13-Aug-15 07:07:07, margo even if it's just a suspicion have a test. I once had a dreadful year thinking I was severely depressed. When I developed pica and saw Dr turned out I was hugely anemic. He just went 'how do you get up in the morning w an iron count that low?' and I think.I cried. I'd spent ages feeling a total failure because everything was hard. Thyroid stuff not as easy a fix as iron levels but they can definitely help w that. Don't put it off
IronMaggie,Fri 02-Oct-15 16:51:02,"Hello everyone! It looks like things have gone super quiet since I was last here...!? I'm now feeling a teensy bit guilty as I think I'm partly to blame for that. I'll put it down to a combination of things being VERY busy for a number of reasons, and then being locked out of the website and app too. But I've worked it all out now. I hope everyone's on an even keel? I'll turn on my notifications again so hopefully I see any new messages, or feel free to PM me if you're needing support or want to chat.I'd like to say that I'm all fixed as a result of being too frantic to binge, but no such luck. I'm still trying to work my way through it, but feeling much less despairing about where I am now. I weighed myself on Monday, after a 6 month break and it didn't send me into a self-loathing spiral which I think is a positive thing. Sending happy vibes to anyone that needs them!"
sleepwhenidie,Fri 05-Feb-16 15:04:43,"Things are good with me thanks Maggie - I have a small but regular handful of lovely clients now and they seem to be very happy with our work together which I find incredibly satisfying and exciting. I am also working up the courage to start running body image workshops, something I trained for shortly before Christmas and feel passionately about. I think they are amazing. They were devised by a clinical psychologist in the US (Dr Melody Moore) who has extensive experience of working with ED's. Embodylove if anyone is interested - they also partner with Proud2BMe - a great body positive facebook page to follow.I remember Fighting and I were so worried about you when you first joined the thread Maggie, you were so, so resistant to the idea of stopping restricting and in despair. You've made incredible progress! I think you should follow your instincts with the competing, now may be too soon to let it go but you might reach a point where you realise what is the right choice for you, the balance - can you let go of making comparisons? If not, at what point is it preventing you from fully enjoying the process of training and competing or hindering your recovery to the extent you need to step away? I do think that making yoga as 'valid' an exercise session as the other stuff in your mind, and fitting some in, would be a good thing too . You could of course experiment with, say, a month of just yoga and jogging and see how you feel. The sky won't fall in, you can go back to the other training if you want to ."
jassS,Fri 05-Feb-16 18:49:45,"And welcome, all newcomers. Wish, especially you. I know you would not believe if we say we have indeed been there, even if not as bad as you.If I think back then the only thing which helped me was accepting i will never again diet. Never. We all here know this struggle out of the hopeless hole were you stuff yourself and helplessly gain, then ""get your act together"" for a couple of months etc.... Only to lose it again and always end up bigger than before.....Well, the way out of the hole is other way. First, I read overcomingovereating.com. They told me what I knew of course - dieting gets you fatter! It does. Always. Over the years, if not in short term. So, the only way is no diet. And it took my mind a whole year to believe I will indeed never diet again. Even now,sometimes, I lapse and condider it, maybe do a day or two, then realise it leads back to binges and wuit hastily.With nodiet, whenyou have finally convinced yourself that all food is equal and if you really want, you can eat it, it loses its allure. Then only comes the realisation that you can actually make healthy choiçes, because you want it. if you believe you can have every chip in the world, suddenly a cherry tomato may becom very appetizing. i remember the aha- moment, after the first year. i faced a reception table full of chips, cheese, etc - and I teuly, honestly craved that cherry tomato withmozarella. The rest I suddenly felt I had had enough. Of course, I havenet kept that feeling for always, sometimes I still crave (and then eat) the previously forbidden things. But as they are allowed anyway, I tend tombe able to focus on things I really want. Then there is the trick which helps a lot with regaining taste for vegetables, fruit etc. - allow youself to eat allyou want, but first make sure you eat what your body needs. As sleep said - your body on your empty carb food is simply starving. Make sure you have had the colorful stuff - the veg and fruit. Then the good fats stuff - fish, avocado, meat. And thereafter eat all you want of your favourite stuff. It helps me to keep eye on positive - I have had my veg, fruit and protein. What else I had, is less important. This way you do not restrict, but can rebalance your diet and regain taste for healthy stuff. Enough for know. Baby steps,remember? It takes at least a couple of years to recover from diet-bust cycle, and then it only means you get into remission. I have lost hope I will ever feel totally unnerveous around the food and indifferent to food. But the enjoyment of a good meal does come back, the binge lessens in intensity and weight gain stops. i understand overweight people evenmanage to effortlessly lose finally, if you read overcominovereater's forums. I never have lost, I have only maintained,but it does not matter anymore. More important is ro be happy, to feel good every evening you have not stuffed yourself like crazy.One more small thing - you say you are up until 2 in the morning - 8h of sleep is a must to beat BED. A sleep-starved body sends a BED sufferer to fridge. It is as sure as 2 plus 2 equals 4.So, you see - it is not you or your willpower. It is simple physiology and it is not your fault that years ago you were advised that diets willbe a cure-all. They are the curse!"
IronMaggie,Fri 19-Feb-16 12:45:48," Margo, I meant to say I was very impressed by your speaking out - I had an incident a few weeks ago where I should have defended someone but didn't speak up because no-one else was (an older lady on the tube was sworn and shouted at for not moving far enough into the carriage). But I felt so guilty afterwards, I really wish I'd been less self-conscious and said something. Since then I've rehearsed it in my mind so many times that if it happened again I'd spring into action immediately!"

PeaceOfWildThings,Fri 12-Jun-15 19:31:57,"I'm just worn out and DH does his best and supports us the best he knows how. He works abroad and so I am pretty much a single parent. We do chat a lot and keep in touch, but when I get depressed and desparately low he feels it is odd for me to be asking him to say nice things about me. He just refuses. Says it feels strange. We need to sort it out. My Dr told me this week I should be on Prozac and she wants me to try it out. I'm struggling with that.Another difficult day. DD2's ed counsellor is trying to get her into outpatient therapy to eat at the unit every day of the summer holidays. So I'll be taking her. So no family holiday or going to stay with DH."
PeaceOfWildThings,Sun 14-Jun-15 14:04:05,"I'm trying out the minipill and I think it is making me depressed I seem to be getting worse by the day. So, stopping tomorrow and will phone the GP. I've asked DH if he can try to get some sort of compassionate leave while I go on Prozac in case I have bad depression as a side effect (the deprssion on the minipill has been hard enough) and because we so desparately need time together as a family before the summer, if DD1 is going to have daily treatment at the ED unit.For us, I'm 99% sure that the genetic factor is the main cause, triggered by puberty. I never thought I had an eating disorder but I can remember hiding food behind the radiator behind my place at the table, and my family trying to get me to eat eggs any every opportunity. When I told my aunt about DD1's ed she said there was a time my mum tried to get advice from every expert in the country in desparation to get me to eat! I didn't believe her at the time, but now I remember a spate of having to go home for lunches (mum worked so it must have been hard for her) and I had to get breakfast with dad. I can remember my brother babysitting me and I wouldn't eat my mashed potato so he picked me up, carried me up to my room, dropped me on my bed and ordered me to stay there. I can remember everyone being worried but not knowing what about, as though they were keeping a secret from me...but I was the one with the secret."
Clare1971,Wed 17-Jun-15 21:54:36," I've just read this thread from start to finish and I'm feeling sick with fear. My DD is 17 and has had eating difficulties for years - eating very little then binging, going on 'proana' websites and weighing herself a lot etc but through it all her weight hasn't changed much - she is currently underweight but not much. I've tried to get her to get help over the years but she completely refuses. She took an overdose last year and dropped out of sixth form, then this year we had several months of serious self harm. She did finally agree to see Camhs and now has a one to one session once a fortnight and is on prozac for depression. We seem to have got through each crisis and the self harm has stopped but now she has stopped eating completely ( a different form of self harm I guess). She ate nothing for four days, had a day where she ate loads of rubbish, and has now stopped eating again (two days so far). Because she is 17 it is difficult to insist on anything. Also because she has been suicidal previously I am terrified of confronting her. We had a long conversation this evening where I managed to keep calm. She cried a bit but insisted she didn't have a problem and was just fasting to see how it felt. I have no idea how to deal with this. Think I will phone her counsellor tomorrow but apart from that am at a loss. One minute I think I need to step in and take control (though I don't know what that would mean in practice) and the next minute I think I should just try to support her to make the right decisions herself. Anyone able to give me any words of advice?"
Clare1971,Thu 25-Jun-15 21:19:49," Feeling pretty hopeless to be honest Calmit. Have spoken briefly to DD and reaction was pretty much as I expected - since the ED clinic are not going to work with her she says she clearly doesn't have a problem and refuses to discuss any changes at all. Also, flatly refused any discussion about family therapy. Partner is away for next few days so we have said we will talk about it again when he gets back. She has eaten one good meal today (before we broached the subject) but ate nothing up till then so I guess she's had about 700 calories altogether today. They don't do bmi for children here - we were just told her weight is in the 84th percentile. They said 85th is the point where they would keep someone off school/work. I've tried to look it up but the only chart I found showed 84th to be in the obese range so I guess that must have been percentiles the other way round or something. The NHS website puts her in the 4th percentile and If I use an adult bmi chart it comes out as 16.9. That was using the weight she weighed when she was fully clothed and after she had eaten reasonably well (for her) for two days so I suspect she has lost another pound or two since then. Not really sure now how underweight this is considered to be."
Clare1971,Sat 04-Jul-15 22:12:58," Hi Lakeland. So sorry you've found yourself here. As heartbreaking as it is, I guess it must be a good thing that your DD was able to voice those thoughts on Friday. Somewhere your lovely girl is still there under all those worries. My DD is a bit older (17) and has been cutting, having suicidal thoughts and restricting calories since she was about 14 but it has only come out into the open over this last year and I feel awful knowing that she struggled alone for so long. I hope camhs were able to offer you something useful."
LakelandLassie,Fri 10-Jul-15 15:05:01,"Thanks Peace for the advice re getting the bloods taken!Unfortunately DD has expressed suicidal thoughts so I was told to lock up all medicines, remove blades and anything she could use as a ligature. That was very scary to hear.There was a lack of communication today between GP/Practice Nurse and CAMHS Dr which has meant 2 trips to GP surgery, 1 trip to CAMHS clinic and 2 trips to Pharmacy.My DM is coming up tomorrow for a few days for moral support. I feel bad that my youngest DD(10) is having no fun at all this summer holidays so at least I'll be able to do something with her for a few days"
LakelandLassie,Fri 07-Aug-15 20:40:55,"Wow- that sounds hard going Peace. I hope the new arrangements are working for you both.Camhs apt for us today. 1kg weight gain, but of course DD was distraught. She admitted once home (was asked at clinic) that she is still self harming and having suicidal thoughts but is ok with me emailing this info to our counsellor. Think she just feels uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of everyone. I'm still not sure what came first- did low mood lead to the anorexia or is the low mood because of the anorexia?? A bit of both maybe?On Wed eve she confessed to still purging which knocked the stuffing out of me a bit. I thought we had been SOOOO vigilant. I just felt done in, that there was nothing left of me that I could give to 'the fight'. Thurs was a crap day! I just couldn't face a battle over 3 snacks and 3 meals. But today was a brand new day and that is going to be my Mantra till the 'war' is over.Take Care"
Taranta,Sun 03-Jan-16 19:47:59,"Hi, not sure you'll see this reply as its a bit late but anyway. I'm in a similar position, just had my second child and got this almost desperate need to be back where I was weight wise as soon as I can because the extra weight is making me look at myself with disgust. DS is doing well at 12 weeks now. But I've been walking miles each day, eating 1200-1500 calories, feeling really depressed if I exceed it (am exclusively breastfeeding too). I've lost a lot of the weight but still have half a stone to get to my pre baby weight. With me I think my years of eating as little as I can get away with has got my body going to starvation mode while breastfeeding, and trained it to store every bit of fat it can and it's not shifting. I feel like the exercise and diet is the only thing stopping me from gaining weight rather than helping me lose it. I hate that it obsesses me, it's so boring! I just can't imagine feeling normal about food!"
Desperatenottoreturn,Fri 24-Apr-15 21:22:18,"It never occurred to me to research why I do it, that makes a lot do sense so thank you for that.From a psychological point of view I'm honestly the happiest I've been in a very long time. I love being a mother and am really enjoying the journey it is taking me on and I'm definitely not depressed. I obviously want to loose the baby weight and deep down I know that b/p is definitely not the answer. I never thought that it could be more physiological.I don't enjoy doing it, I don't particularly like or enjoy the food I eat when I binge, I hate the fact that I don't taste and enjoy it but just stuff it in as fast as I can. I hate the feeling of being stuffed, I hate the taste and smell when I purge and what it has done to my teeth. I hate the wastage and the money it costs... So why the fuck do I keep on going back to it?I think I have this deep fear of being hungry and I'm not sure where it has come from. I have tried to tell myself it is ok to be hungry but it seems that instead of eating food when I'm hungry like normal people I seem to keep on going back to massive b/p episodes instead. I tried the 5:2 to address some of these fears but it just seemed to make me worse.I would love to tell my DH but he really doesn't understand, he doesn't really believe in mental illness and although he has been massively supportive I'm not sure he has actually helped either if that makes sense at all!This is the first time I've actually written it all down and it does feel odd it not somewhat cathartic"
HouseHell,Sat 25-Oct-14 07:06:08,Please can I join you. I have a massive problem with binge eating and it's making me terribly depressed. I purchased a couple of self help books a few months ago but still haven't read them. I've got to do something...I'm out of control. I'm also at the point where I'm avoiding doing stuff because I hate how I look so much. 
Sleepwhenidie,Wed 12-Nov-14 10:09:12,"Fighting  - you of all people know that this process isn't linear . It's a sign of your progress that you didn't freak out or feel hopeless after the binge. Do you know what caused it?Purple - job sounds good - hours clashing with DH's time off not so much . Hope it gets sorted.Rosey yes, I do believe you can relearn coping mechanisms. I also think some one to one work would be good for you. The people who have lost a great deal of weight and kept it off don't often have more willpower than anyone else, but there will typically have been some kind of shift elsewhere in their lives, on an emotional/stress/fulfilment type level. Can you tell us some more about yourself?goodas - perhaps building in something you would normally try not to eat into your day (like Violet) would be a good thing to try too - you don't have to eat it, but give yourself the choice. If you do decide you want it, then relax and enjoy - no guilt or regret. I wonder if you are getting enough calories generally though, when you exercise so much particularly. If this is the case then it could be contributing to the binges. See how you go with the slightly higher level of carbs. I also think relaxing is a very big thing with you. Stress (including and especially) stress around food will impede your metabolism and digestion. No matter how 'perfect' your diet your body will be digesting less efficiently than it can and producing cortisol, which prompts your body to store fat and dump muscle. Mindfulness, relaxation and slow eating will all help."
EEVEElution,Mon 15-Dec-14 09:20:29,"Hello Deerhound, nice to meet you. I've been lurking the past few days so I'll post my 'story' as well, although it's a little hard to write.I've always had a bad relationship with food, I obsess about it constantly, my parents always fed me healthy food though so I was able to stay healthy until I left home. Since then my weight has been steadily increasing. I am now 28 years old, 5'10 and a size 20, I definitely fall into the obese category and will end up morbidly obese if I don't stop.I binge on junk food a lot, I try to stop myself but feel like I can't control it, I'll eat and eat until I feel sick but no matter how much I get it never seems to satisfy me for very long. I can easily spend £100+ on food, that's just the junk not including the normal weekly shop. My husband tells me off all the time as I'm wasting money but still I can't control it. I get the cravings and order takeaways in the middle of the day or go to the local tesco and buy tons of junk. Any junk food I have always gets eaten in the same day no matter how much there is, I can't leave it alone.This all absolutely terrifies me, sometimes I find it hard to get to sleep at night because I'm worrying I will just keep getting bigger and bigger and eat myself into an early grave. My wedding ring won't come off as it's now wedged on. I really, really want to change but every attempt so far has failed. I'll start will things like weightwatchers and initially feel really positive, play silly montages in my head where I lose tons of weight and end up a success story, inspiring others to do the same. What happens in reality is I do well for a few weeks, then fall off the wagon and when I have a bad weigh in I get so depressed and think sod it, then back to square one. But it's not even back to square one because I always end up heavier than I started.I just want to be like normal people! Not to think constantly about food and be able to make rational choices about what I eat. It's taken me a while to realise it's a psychological problem but I'm unsure about where to start with getting help. I've seen OA mentioned on here so may give that a try, there is one local to me.Thanks for reading.."
IronMaggie,Tue 16-Dec-14 22:57:22,"Thanks for popping in Sleep, it's always good to hear from you.In an effort to curb sugar, I'm attempting to go 'Paleo' at the moment, however all that means is that I binge on fruit and nuts, rather than biccies and chocolate. I know that it's not really any better, but until I find a strategy that actually works to resolve my disordered eating, I can at least minimise the damage (that's my current theory anyway)??The other day I went to at least 5 different shops / newsagents, buying bits here and there, making excuses to the lady at the till, pretending the chocolates were gifts / I was having people over etc. It's ridiculous. I feel like I come on to this thread every few days and spout off about my current strategy, thinking it'll work, then realising after a couple of days that it was all hopeless because I've slipped again and eaten everything in sight. Fighting I know you've said in the past that the road to recovery isn't linear, but I don't even think I'm remotely going in the right direction.For some reason I've convinced myself that come the new year I'll be all fixed (obviously my main new year's resolution is to 'eat like a normal person'), but I do know that there's no way that can realistically happen. Rubbish.Sorry to bring everyone down. On a positive note, welcome deerhound, very pleased to have you here! I haven't tried OA myself, I think Italian is your expert there."
FightingBed2014,Mon 22-Dec-14 13:40:38,"Margo it sounds like you have made some significant changes that are making life much happier. You have come such a long way, you should be proud. I think worrying about access to food at Christmas is normal. It is very hard to avoid. Work with it, if you can. It will be there and it is likely you may eat more than normal. We all know complete avoidance will make you want to literally dive in and eat it as you slide across . Shut that demon down and allow yourself a little more but also occupy your time with games and anything else fun. You may stop worrying a while and not actually eat as much. I will have to follow this as my mood has gone to a more depressed state and that brings binges. Although I am not ill now, which is good.x"
IronMaggie,Tue 06-Jan-15 13:57:21,"hey newme - welcome. I'm so glad you've joined us. I wish I could offer some words of advice for you, but people like fighting and sleep are probably best placed to. I just want you to know that you're doing a good job already by wanting to get better, and reaching out to get help and support. During my lowest periods I've found it hard to be part of the group as everything seemed so hopeless and I didn't feel I had anything to add. But please know that things can and will get better.From reading through the archives of the blog that lamb posted yesterday, the lady on there says she's a permanent calorie counter. I tried to stop counting a few months ago (in an effort to be 'normal' and things spiralled out of control very quickly), so the idea appeals to me. I don't feel like I can necessarily trust myself to eat intuitively, as I just know I'd ramp back up to 6,000+cals per day without some sort of accountability. What's the best way, does anyone know?"
sleepwhenidie,Mon 19-Jan-15 22:22:13,"Welcome toomuch please know that you are very far from alone in this . Wrt reading, I'd highly recommend 'Eating in the light of the moon', it's not CBT but it should help you stop feeling like BED is a failing on your part, it isn't. There are many, many reasons behind it and very often it is a coping mechanism that is very understandable, the problem is, too often we try and and battle it by dieting and restricting food and it makes the whole situation worse. That is why the most useful first step to recovery is a move away from dieting. The other big step is to accept that a binge is not 'wrong'. There can be biological causes - restrict your nutrient intake enough on diets and your body will demand that you eat, or if you have an 'addictive response' to certain foods (which will invariably be highly processed, high sugar foods that are often manufactured with the express goal of hitting your 'bliss point and making you want more). We might also overeat due to boredom or habit, in which case finding distractions can be useful. But more often, a binge will be a 'place holder' for something else in your life that needs to change. Often it could be that you are maintaining a strong level of control in other areas, or you have learned to stuff down certain (or even all) emotions or things you really need to speak out loud. It could be a way of filling a gap elsewhere, a lack of affection, of intellectual stimulation, creative expression, sexual intimacy, living authentically, letting go of the idea of perfection (whether physical or generally), physical expression....so in this sense it is a way of learning about yourself. It could be seen as a good thing - rather than food, you could be turning to drugs or alcohol, you could become severely depressed, or by completely 'switching off' and succeeding in denying the urge to binge, physical illness in some form may emerge. I really believe that our bodies have an innate wisdom to tell us what we really need and we must practice tuning into it and listening. "
Lilylulu,Fri 06-Feb-15 11:45:46,"I am new - hello! Hope you don't mind me joining you Feeling very low. I am single Mum to a toddler with a terrible, terrible binge problem. I've had a long history with anorexia with multiple hospital admissions in my teens. I'm now in my 30's and am holding bmi at the bottom end of healthy around 18.5 - mainly through bingeing. I eat in excess of 8-10,000 calories in each binge (which last all day and can go on until the early hours) and then do not eat anything for days to make up for it. I am exhausted, depressed and at the end of my tether with it. I don't now what to do next. My binges are debilitating to the point I can't move/breathe. I am trying to stick to a meal plan to regulate my eating patterns, but the binges come anyway. And then I feel so ill and disgusted with myself that I starve myself again. Sorry for the rant! does anyone here have such extreme binges like me? (Not just a packet of biscuits!)"
nowitsenough,Tue 17-Mar-15 17:06:36," Definitely it has to do with complex emotions. I don't feel very happy about myself, am depressed and unhappy. I don't know how to learn to like myself? [confued] Maybe that's what I need to learn first?"
GratefulHead,Sat 28-Mar-15 14:12:20,"Hello all once again, thank you all for the welcome :-)I am trying to avoid bringing crisps into the house. I am also avoiding things like crackers which go far too well with butter and marmite!I am also trying to drink more water as I find I have more energy if I do.I plan to write in a journal but am not very good at remembering stuff like that so food diary stuff sends me into despair as I often forget to write it all down.I am also trying to be kind to myself and remember that I have a lot to deal with. Food is my drug of choice and it's what I go to when I am stressed. I am trying to find a few food recipes that are nice and simple but look special so I can spoil myself in a different way with food.I have the Fairburn book (the older edition) and am going to dig it out."
mollister,Thu 09-Apr-15 13:54:49,"Thanks sleepwhenidie I have read through the threads and there is a lot that sounds familiar.I've had talking therapy and CBT - though neither were for weight issues and I am on mild anti-depressant so I feel as though I must have the tools somehow to deal with this but it feels utterly hopeless.I cannot bear the way it colours every part of my life and I always think that people will see my fat before they see me.I have been on my own (without a partner) for most of my life and although I am not ugly and I see much fatter and less fortunate people than me with partners I always think my singleness is about my weight.So of course it is a vicious circle - eat, remorse, loathing, eat again "
runningLou,Sat 11-Apr-15 07:02:29,"Difficult few days here - not quite sure why except maybe being on hols and having DH and DC around all the time is more draining than fun?! We are off to France today for a week to stay with DH's family. I always gain weight over there as we are stuffed with food from all sides. Hate the fact that I am thus made to spend a week in binge mode (if the food's offered, I find it very, very hard to say no), and am unable to restrict due to being a guest in someone's house. I know full well that weight-gain is not inevitable (French women don't get fat etc) but I have just lost that gauge of what is a 'normal' meal, a 'normal' portion. Whatever I eat, whenever I eat it, I gain weight. There must be a way to eat normal food and not gain, right?! I am not a fan of MFP having tried to use it in the past and found it made me make stupid calorie calculations (who knew a kit-kat had fewer calories than a banana with natural yogurt and sunflower/pumpkin seeds?! Who knew peanut butter was the devil's food?!) so I just don't know how to have 3 normal meals a day. All I would like to do is maintain weight, for this week at least. But HOW?! At the moment I feel like all I have to do is look at food to gain. Yesterday I had a green juice for breakfast, with a small slice of toast and peanut butter. For lunch, cucumber, carrot and mange-tout with houmous, a tuna sandwich (it was a picnic), 2 go-ahead biscuits and an apple. For dinner, a bowl of homemade veg soup with bread and cheese, a bowl of salad with sliced turkey, then homemade lemon and raisin muffins with custard. This morning's weigh-in: 3lbs up on yesterday!!! I know I had a dessert after dinner, which was giving in to temptation as it was a stupid decision to bake but wanted to finish up ingredients in the fridge before going on holiday. But surely it wasn't a 3lb gain day?! Anyway, I am utterly unable to make sensible decisions at the moment about food. I know in my head if I eat 3 reasonable meals a day I shouldn't gain that much but I cannot put it into practice. My rhythm has just become restricting to undo the work of a bad day. I saw a doc at ED service this week after GP finally referred me. She listened to everything I said, then concluded I was not depressed, nor clinically anxious, and didn't really have an eating disorder either as BMI has always been normal and laxative use obviously doesn't fit definition of abuse. She was really nice and I didn't feel patronised but I left thinking - if I'm not clinically anxious then god help those who are!! Leaving I felt a little bit more positive about my body so allowed myself to go into a bakery as have been craving hot cross buns all Easter and not had one. Bought a pack of 4, opened it, took one tiny sliver, ate it, felt like I couldn't control not eating all of them and binned it. I feel like an utter freak walking around in the body of a fairly normal-looking person. Yesterday I was packing for France - it's really warm over there now - none of my summer clothes fit any more so I had to dig out my fat jeans from a few years ago, which are snug now. Feel utterly wretched today. Cannot face the decisions around food that today will bring."
TheGirlInTheGlass,Thu 12-Feb-15 10:07:58,"PS. Find out pronto where her money is coming from. If she wants something, maybe tell her she can choose items when you do the weekly shop?I know it seems easier for me having gotten through it, and now knowing his reasons, but I feel your pain. I've done all the blaming myself, wondering what was wrong- it didn't help at all that I went into a despairing pity-pit (not saying you are, just that I did) at first. So don't fall into that trap like I did, as soon as I stopped that and got practical, things were on use up.I hope that it's nothing serious medically, and that you'll both be ok."
annie23littlies,Sat 17-Jan-15 11:58:12,hi please could someone give me some advice my son is 13 and has been Binge eating off and on for a while now..it first started when my Husband and I Divorced 3 years ago.I find hidden in his room chocolate wrappers empty crisp packets by the dozen. Ive never stopped him eating sweets but i dont no what to do next.hes depressed and unhappy i am just sad to see him like this.
yegodsandlittlefishes,Sat 08-Feb-14 15:59:58,"The thing is, even if you (or I) had known sooner, there is nothing anyone can do about it until the person with the ED is willing to say they have a problem and get some help for it. You have done all you can possibly do under such circumstances.As I've said before, we're pretty sure DD has had some aspect of this, the beginnings of the MH/hypothalmus problem since birth, and puberty has been the trigger of her sh and ED. This is from our last family session:Psych: so how long have you been having suicidal thoughts, MissYego?DD: for as long as I can rememberPsych: so...before the ED then?DD: Yes, before the ED, for a long time before...ME: You mean, even in primary school?DD: yesMe: Even where we used to live (infant school)?DD: yes. (To me) Don't you remember that time when I was about 6, I was sitting on your lap (at our old house) and I asked you something to do with ending life/suicide (can't remember exact words) and you pushed me off your lap and told me never to talk about that kind of thing ever again!?Me: (crying) but...I was depressed then and having counselling, I thought you had overheard something or were copying me or something like that. My counsellor told me you couldn't be depressed and I believed her! I was trying to protect you from my depression....It doesn't make it my fault any more than it is her fault. would it be my fault if she had cancer, or a heart defect? So equally your daughter's illness cannot be your fault. People with eating disorders hide it. The school didn't flag it up, and they see her beside her peers on a daily basis. Parents are the last to spot these things as we love unconditionally."
StolenStollen,Sat 08-Feb-14 22:18:30,Yes. We dont see it because we are blinded by love. We don't want to see any wrong with our children. I am sorry your dd has had suicidal thoughts for so so long Ye. DD has been feeling suicidal but not sure for how long. She told me 9 months and her cahms lady 2 years.
yegodsandlittlefishes,Fri 28-Feb-14 19:13:28,"They should not have made you say you couldn't cope, I really think that should not happen. It should be on BMI. That was wrong of them in my opinion, and if you can manage a very polite complaint, please do. I would sign a petition to get that changed if it is their policy.It must have been so scary to see her thin and covered in sick when you got back from work. No wonder you yelled, it is a normal reaction to see someone you love putting themselves in danger. It is like the way we shout at our children when they are little and step onto a road, or we lose them because they wander off. Don't feel bad. If you weren't a good mum, you wouldn't have shouted or cared. Also, when depressed it does mean we feel down on ourselves too, so have to sift between which things are ok to feel sad about and which thoughts are piling on guilt or fear and have to be let go of. It's tiring to work through it. Dd has found the charity MIND to be good, and so as the Mumsnet Woolly Hugs people are raising money for them with an Easter fair, I'm making some crafts for it too. It has brightened up my day a bit."
MrsMargoLeadbetter,Wed 29-Jun-16 20:09:03,"Difficult day here. Had a nice day out with DD but was so focused on size, it took the shine off. Also she was looking with such love and admiration at me, but all I could think was about negative size related thoughts. Food has been ok. I didn't eat breakfast early enough I think too which probably didn't help. I also didn't snack in time as I felt self-conscious about eating in public/being overweight and daring to eat!Really tired. Going to go to bed soon and hopefully tomorrow will be a brighter day!"
BursarsFrogs,Tue 12-Jul-16 08:56:41,"Morning everyone. I've been reading Overcoming Binge Eating, and have mixed feelings about it. A lot of the things don't really ""fit"" for me somehow. I'm also disappointed that it (like most other books) says you can't think about losing weight while tackling the ED. I actually kind of realised that if I'm totally honest, the main reason I want to tackle my ED is so that I could lose weight - not so I could just be healthier etc.  Not thinking about my weight is also sadly not really an option... I get weighed a lot in hospitals and I'm pre-diabetic, and can also access fertility treatments as long as my BMI is under a certain limit. I'm starting to think this round of IVF hasn't worked. Still a few days till I'll know for sure though. We still have a couple of embryos in the freezer, but if we're to need another fresh cycle I'm seriously going to need to crash diet, as bad as I know it will be for me. I'm having a really shit morning really. I feel fat, hormonal, depressed and ashamed of everything about myself. It all definitely makes me want to binge. But I've had a normal filling breakfast and I'm trying to just get on with things."
BursarsFrogs,Mon 18-Jul-16 21:27:21,"Thank you Margo. We have three embryos left in the freezer, and we should be able to go ahead for a transfer with them in a few months' time, all being well. If that doesn't work we'll need to move to a new fresh cycle (we have one NHS funded left still), and it's before that that I'd need to lose some weight. I'm not enjoying the hot weather. I'm too self-conscious to wear summery clothes, but at least I didn't wear a jacket today! Had a loose short sleaved shirt on that was fairly cooled and covered my upper arms and my bum. I know it doesn't make me look any less fat, but it feels less revealing. I've decided to give the self help plan in Overcoming Binge Eating a go, so I'm keeping the recommended food diary. I did have a binge today, and writing down what I ate wasn't exactly fun. I managed by promising myself I don't have to show it to anyone!I hope you're all managing to keep cool and enjoy the summer while it lasts."
ChanceBeAFineThing,Tue 11-Oct-16 19:58:37,"I'm still here. Still flirting between coping and not. Caught myself starting to binge and stopped it in progress. A bit bummed out that I started, but going to try and focus on the positive. New and Maggie I also struggle with apps. I like to know what's a normal or appropriate portion size, and watch what I'm eating (because I think I'm subconsciously trying to lose weight still). I also want to not use them and sometimes don't. I try and listen to my body and how hungry it is, and not get depressed if I've eaten a bit much at the weekend, say. I don't want to go too far. I recognise obsessive behaviours in them, but want to check what's an appropriate amount IYSWIM? It's all a bit hit and miss with them at the moment. Overall, I guess I'm ok. I think for me to be ""fixed"" is the process of learning how to live with my continual thoughts and obsessions about food. I don't think they'll ever go away, I just need to be able to manage them? Or do they go away? Hmmmmm."
MrsMargoLeadbetter,Tue 18-Oct-16 00:01:18,"HelloSorry for not posting. I was waiting for the ""perfect"" time to post, which never came! And once it dropped off my 'Threads I am on' it seemed like a big jump to post. So glad to hear the studies have started fighting. Such an amazing step. Well done for talking about the ED too. Has anyone brought it up again?Hope the move went ok Newyear?I am not sure calorie counting will ever work for ""us"", as the fact we are doing it hints at trying to control I guess? Which probably means restrict?Well done on going to the Dr's Maggie, sorry to hear about the anaemia. Hope the tablets help soon. I am slightly too, I wonder if there is a link between EDs and anaemia.Had a really busy period with work - worked everyday for 3 weeks. Eating wasn't too bad but I did virtually no exercise which isn't good for my mental health. I keep having moments of despair where I wish I could be thinner. I feel really lost as to how I should ""be"" now re food/feelings around food. I am struggling to let go of becoming smaller thoughts. However, the rational part of me knows that my self-esteem is the real issue and not the food or my body. Might try a counsellor for that. Was also toying with the idea of a stylist, there is a local one who is fairly affordable, as I am just so depressed having to order large 'cover up' clothes but I am just not sure I can hold it together to talk through clothes /body shape feeling as I do. And she isn't expecting to offer counselling as well as style advice!!I also keep having flash backs to having PND, not sure I am completely over it. On a more positive note I am enjoying this woman's podcasts - www.lifeunrestricted.org/ She was a national radio host in Switzerland but has turned her back on that is now a body positive person. She is a nice change from the American podcasters that are all a bit OTT.How is everyone doing? Any plans for half-term if yours is coming up?"
CeciledeVolanges,Sat 14-Jan-17 23:25:58,"I've found out that a close relative of mine who has had severe anorexia uses proanorexia websites. They are younger than I am and I can't tell their parents or confront them directly (due to past history, denial and other issues I don't want to go into). They are studying at the moment.

fatsomumoftwo,Wed 07-Sep-16 10:12:59,"I've been trying to count calories at the moment, after having two kids I am now obese. My DS is now 6 months old but he still wakes up at nights and most days I'm exhausted from lack of sleep. That's when I tend to binge eat. It's terrible, I come downstairs and all I can think about is what can I stuff my face with... It's making me depressed that I don't seem to be able to control these urges. The very few days here and there that I've managed to get decent sleep I'm so full energy and determination, exercising and eating salads and then the next day after a bad night of sleeping only 3 hours I sit on the sofa eating cake all day! Has anyone gone through anything like this and how did you manage to pull yourself together? Please no nasty comments I'm already hating myself enough over this and I don't need anyone else putting me down too..."
Count2three,Thu 20-Oct-16 18:59:47,"Hi,Sorry to hear of this. I was bulimic at your DD's age (age 16-21). Going to the GP didn't help but he was particularly useless and blamed me. On reflection I think I was depressed. I also drank heavily and took recreational drugs. Have you considered contacting the Eating Disorder's Association for advice? I got better when I got happy, which in my case was meeting my lovely DP who loved me unconditionally. Hopefully someone else will be ofMore help. "
IamAporcupine,Mon 11-Jul-16 21:54:19,"thanks everyoneMellifera no, he's never had therapy and I know he will never ever accept it. I am sure he is quite familiar with schema therapy as he is a therapist himself .... AnchorDownDeepBreath I am angry for different reasons, but definitely not for the relapse itself. the short answer would be I am angry because he can't talk to me. but I am also angry because I do everything to try to accommodate his needs so that he can be more in control. we eat different food, we usually do not eat together, we can hardly eat out, we can't go to friends' meals, we spend very little time together because his exercise is first etc etc etc. yet I feel if I was to bring it up I'd be told to fuck off and stop imagining things like he did last time. he is grumpy and difficult most of the time and I do not know if I can cope anymore. I love him but he's become so distant...I do not think it will trigger my own issues. I have been trying to lose weight and get back in shape for ages, but I am so fucking depressed I can't even do that. thanks for caring It's a good suggestion, but I do not think I could take control of his food.DavidPuddy I totally understand how difficult it is and I would never push him or judge him. As I said, I just wished he would reach to me "
kate60,Wed 17-Feb-16 17:02:03,Does anyone by any chance know of a good and kind dietician in Edinburgh? My daughter was very poorly with anorexia and she is now mentally much better but needs help and support with getting her weight up. She is up at Edinburgh university and a long way from home but determined to manage. The university has been hopeless with no support at all. Lots of thanks
RegentsParkWolf,Mon 20-Jun-16 20:24:25," Sorry to hear that frogs. I haven't got any further with DD. She has been to see the dr about her insomnia and dr has changed her to a different antidepressant. I'm concerned as the one she was on did seem to help her mood and I think her insomnia is really down to not having a routine - she sleeps all day and is up all night but I'm not sure she explained that to dr, just said she couldn't get to sleep. The new antidepressant is known for causing weight gain. I think the dr probably thought that would be helpful as DD is very underweight but I think it will make the bulimia worse. I don't think DD would have told the dr about the bulimia. On the plus side, DD felt the dr had listened to her instead of talking down to her and she has made another appointment so I'm hoping if she feels she can trust the dr she might open up about the bulimia. Trouble is, I don't think she wants to get better - I think she likes to be able to eat lots but stay thin. I feel a bit hopeless to be honest. Hope your DD gets through the A levels. If the bulimia is a response to stress maybe it will settle when the stress is less?"
PeaceOfWildThings,Fri 12-Jun-15 19:31:57,"I'm just worn out and DH does his best and supports us the best he knows how. He works abroad and so I am pretty much a single parent. We do chat a lot and keep in touch, but when I get depressed and desparately low he feels it is odd for me to be asking him to say nice things about me. He just refuses. Says it feels strange. We need to sort it out. My Dr told me this week I should be on Prozac and she wants me to try it out. I'm struggling with that.Another difficult day. DD2's ed counsellor is trying to get her into outpatient therapy to eat at the unit every day of the summer holidays. So I'll be taking her. So no family holiday or going to stay with DH."
PeaceOfWildThings,Sun 14-Jun-15 14:04:05,"I'm trying out the minipill and I think it is making me depressed I seem to be getting worse by the day. So, stopping tomorrow and will phone the GP. I've asked DH if he can try to get some sort of compassionate leave while I go on Prozac in case I have bad depression as a side effect (the deprssion on the minipill has been hard enough) and because we so desparately need time together as a family before the summer, if DD1 is going to have daily treatment at the ED unit.For us, I'm 99% sure that the genetic factor is the main cause, triggered by puberty. I never thought I had an eating disorder but I can remember hiding food behind the radiator behind my place at the table, and my family trying to get me to eat eggs any every opportunity. When I told my aunt about DD1's ed she said there was a time my mum tried to get advice from every expert in the country in desparation to get me to eat! I didn't believe her at the time, but now I remember a spate of having to go home for lunches (mum worked so it must have been hard for her) and I had to get breakfast with dad. I can remember my brother babysitting me and I wouldn't eat my mashed potato so he picked me up, carried me up to my room, dropped me on my bed and ordered me to stay there. I can remember everyone being worried but not knowing what about, as though they were keeping a secret from me...but I was the one with the secret."
Clare1971,Wed 17-Jun-15 21:54:36," I've just read this thread from start to finish and I'm feeling sick with fear. My DD is 17 and has had eating difficulties for years - eating very little then binging, going on 'proana' websites and weighing herself a lot etc but through it all her weight hasn't changed much - she is currently underweight but not much. I've tried to get her to get help over the years but she completely refuses. She took an overdose last year and dropped out of sixth form, then this year we had several months of serious self harm. She did finally agree to see Camhs and now has a one to one session once a fortnight and is on prozac for depression. We seem to have got through each crisis and the self harm has stopped but now she has stopped eating completely ( a different form of self harm I guess). She ate nothing for four days, had a day where she ate loads of rubbish, and has now stopped eating again (two days so far). Because she is 17 it is difficult to insist on anything. Also because she has been suicidal previously I am terrified of confronting her. We had a long conversation this evening where I managed to keep calm. She cried a bit but insisted she didn't have a problem and was just fasting to see how it felt. I have no idea how to deal with this. Think I will phone her counsellor tomorrow but apart from that am at a loss. One minute I think I need to step in and take control (though I don't know what that would mean in practice) and the next minute I think I should just try to support her to make the right decisions herself. Anyone able to give me any words of advice?"

I know what u mean with the mood swings.they're terrible aren't they?Ive also been very down/depressed. Talk to yr Dr again& see what they say.Sorry I can't be more help.Good luck!
Deadsouls,Sun 26-Feb-17 21:31:11,"Hello all, I wondered if anyone had experienced the same, or if I'm just depressed or what the hell is going on. I've been reading up on hormone imbalance and I'm suspecting that I may be off kilter, but anyway...I'm almost 43. I think my mum started the menopause proper when she was 49. I have really bad night sweats, that wake me up, and to the extent that my nightclothes are wet. I end up taking them off. My pmt is just awful. I feel tearful, emotional, angry all over the place. I don't sleep properly it feels like ever. Can't remember a good nights sleep. I feel grumpy and angry a lot of the time. Just pissed off. There are times when I've been feeling deeply fatigued, exhausted to my bones. I don't know what I want. Maybe just to rest and sleep for a week. For about 2 weeks out of 4 in my cycle, I get really dry red skin around my mouth and chin. It's quite embarrassing, as it's flaky and nothing alleviates it. Nowhere else just my chin. The question is, is this just me? Or are these signs of perimenopause. My period is pretty regular still. Or am I imbalanced hormonally or what?!"
PollyPerky,Mon 27-Feb-17 09:06:33,"In a word, yes. It sounds like peri meno.See your GP but be prepared for them to be hopeless on things like this unless you are lucky, so ask for a referral to a gynae who specialises in early meno- you are too young at 43 for this."
cosytoaster,Wed 01-Mar-17 08:53:00," I'm 51 and definitely peri menopausal - don't have all your symptoms but can very much relate to the hormonal mood swings - mine are random and pretty extreme; I do sometimes think I'm depressed, but then hey presto I'm back to normal.I also suffer from ongoing sleeplessness."

gleegeek,Sat 25-Feb-17 00:19:27,"OMG! You have pretty well described me to a 'T'. Went to the gp and was told at nearly 46 I'm too young for the perimenopause! Have you had any racing heart type symptoms too or horrific nausea??? I feel like I'm going mad... I left the surgery with a prescription for proactive but feel too scared to start down that route. I'm not at all depressed and the anxiety doesn't seem to relate to real worries, it's just there. Aaagh I hate being a woman at times! I almost feel like i did when I was pregnant (I'm definitely not!) So feel it could be hormones but periods are still fairly regular but different in length and style."
thekingfisher,Sat 25-Feb-17 13:25:20,"Joto, would you consider seeing someone privately? I went to my GP with similar symptoms - i'm younger however, but had had a hysterectomy(retaining my ovaries) As i had no periods to track the GP did blood tests which came back 'normal' (Ha!) So she tried to suggest that that was that. I was clear that I couldn't continue feeling as I did - she then tried to offer me AD's - i clearly stated that i wasn't depressed and finally she did agree to refer me to a consultant who specialised in menopause issues. It was a really frustrating process as she ignored the NICE guidelines, tried to offer me AD's and only when I said that I needed more assistance than being reassured I wasn't about to die ( according to the blood tests) did she reluctantly refer me. This is the GP who is supposed to be the specialist in the surgery in women health. Anyhow saw the consultant and within 10 minutes of talking through my symptoms etc she had said in her mind I was clearly menopausal and prescribed Evorel 75 ( a patch) .I'm only at the end of the first week and I can't say i ve noticed huge changes - however my sleep has improved immeasurably and I fancied a shag .... so some upside! I was just so disappointed in the GP, it wasn't like the consultant needed any persuading or convincing...."
Joto369,Wed 01-Mar-17 11:25:35, So just spoken to GP. 'We only prescribe HRT for flushes as there is no proven link between HRT and reduction of anxiety'. Explained I don't feel depressed or anxious all the time but have an awful spaced out feeling (which lifts eventually) and yes occasional anxiety/panic attacks (2 since last week) 'That's what happens when you are anxious all the time - AD's would help'.
PoshPenny,Tue 29-May-12 22:09:48,"Just on my 3rd pack of the stuff. Have been to GP today and have a further 3 months supply. I don't think I've settled down completely yet, but I am feeling oh so much better than I did before I started to take it. Periods are still a bit haywire, and I was dreadfully low (suicidal thoughts) by the time I finished the first pack, then perked up once back just on oestrogen. Luckily no repeat of that last month. So today we decided a bit longer was required before we considered any tweaking. Hot flushes gone and I am sleeping better. I am 47 if of interest. I didn't realise just how bad I was feeling until I started on Elleste and began to feel better. I feel I am in control of my life again. I would say its a good 2 years since I last felt as well as I do now."
susanann,Mon 10-Dec-12 13:34:07,"hi everyone! Like many of you on here ive just been prescribed with the ""magic pills"" Elleste Duet, 1mg. Im 52 and divorced. Just found this site and this thread. It sounds very encouraging and I hope it works for me too. I also suffer from depression which doesnt help cos some of the emotional symptoms are the same. I have felt awful for ages. Sleep is very difficult, but thats also depression related. Im moody, tearful, depressed, have quite bad hot flushes (day and night). My memory is very bad and I find it hard to concentrate. My fiance has been so good and supportive but im sure it must get him down too. So nice to know you guys out there know where im coming from! Its great to have a support network. Take care. x"
backtosanity,Mon 17-Jun-13 22:18:38,"HiSo glad I found this site. I really thought it was only me that had not been coping! Here`s my story...At 38 years old I didn`t have a period for two months and was having hot sweats day and night every 20 minutes. Had an appointment with a gynecologist but had a period before seeing him and was told all was fine. Then the brain fog, anxiety and weird thoughts started. I`d lay awake at night scared of any little noise even my own shadow, during the day constantly making silly mistakes at work. I eventually went to see my doctor convinced I was losing the plot. After blood tests it was confirmed the beginning of early menopause. Over the next couple of years I only had 2 shows (spotting) and now not had a period for 7 years. I really missed them at first (strange I know) but soon appreciated the benefits..no period pains and best of all no PMT. Throughout this time I have avoided HRT scared of it to be honest due to the side effects it may cause..up until now. I really thought I could do this cold turkey but my sweats have been constant, disturbed sleep, my libido is zilch, sex is VERY painful, over the years I`ve had itching under the skin, hair loss, hair growth on chin. no interest or energy for anything, painful hands and really dark/suicidal thoughts. I am 47 but feel 77 (no disrespect to fit 77 year olds) so have finally given in to HRT. I no longer care about the serious risks it may carry, I`ve decided to try and drag some quality of life back as I no longer recognize myself. I am on day 11 of Estelle Duet Conti tabs and though the first few days my sweats were more severe I`m now starting to feel a little different. Had a couple of good nights sleep, fewer sweats less severe and the brain fog clearing a little. Apart from my partner complaining I`m not paying him much attention as I don`t sit and stroke/tickle him! (poor sod eh!) I`m hoping i`m on the up.......fingers crossed"
Linda152,Wed 09-Oct-13 10:52:56,"Hi everyone I'm new to the sight. I'm 50 and had my first Estelle 1mg yesterday.

I never realised how depressed I've been till I read some of the post on here, it is just how I'm feeling. Well looking forward to seeing the outcome, will keep you posted."

Nightfury1,Tue 27-Dec-16 22:47:33,"Thank you so much for replying Until the age of 32, I spent all those years being ignorant to feel like a normal person - I didn't suffer from any of the meno symptoms, only those mentioned in my previous response, therefore I didn't start taking Alendronic until I was 32. The reason I found out I was suffering from Premature Menopause is because my periods were becoming non-existent. My scan revealed a very thin bone mass in my hip area. If I am sure he also said something along the lines of a 70-year-old! I was shocked, despite not experiencing any bone problems. That is when my doctor prescribed me those tablets. Fast forward to September 2016, my gyno was shocked and concerned and explained my low-risk effect, hence choosing to go on HRT. So, to answer your question, in short, I don't currently have Osteoporosis yet, but, if I am not careful, I will suffer from it.I am currently suffering from PMS and I get it worse than when I wasn't on HRT. During normal days, I constantly feel like I am going through an experience of mild PMS. With that said, if I do choose the sequential option, I will definitely experience less of the symptoms/side-effects I mentioned in my post? I would happily change my cycle for this reaon! I think I will go back to 2 pumps!I really hope the side-effects subside, the large painful breasts are the worse and I was already large to start with. The weight is annoying, I'm naturally slim, so my clothes feel tight! Also, I use to be happy and now I feel moody and a bit depressed! I'm really not use to all this!May I ask if you gained any weight or enlarged breasts?I have heard of the Daisy network many years ago but chose to be ignorant - I know, bad choice. However, I will look into it, thank you for reminding me. I'll also see if I can have better contact with my gyno, so she can be in charge of my HRT journey, failing that, I will look into the Westminster area Thank you so much "
PollyPerky,Tue 17-Jan-17 08:41:37,"You need to find another GP.What yours has prescribed goes against all medical advice including NICE menopause guidelines.NICE has made it VERY clear to GPs that ADs should not be prescribed for menopause unless a woman is depressed (or has a history of breast cancer when ADs become one option.)Here Do not routinely offer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or clonidine as first-line treatment for vasomotor symptoms alone.Moreover, you are only 45 so you ought - routinely- to be given HRT to protect your bones and heart, up to the age of 52 (average age of menopause.) at least after which you can chose what to do.The risks of HRT do not apply to women your age - only once we get to 50+ and even then they are tiny risks.Clearly your GP doesn't know anything about treating menopause or is being a dinosaur and avoiding HRT at all costs, so you either need to educate them by showing them the NICE guidelines and advice for women having an early menopause, or find someone who knows what they are doing!"
babayjane67,Tue 07-Feb-17 17:25:50,THanks Polly that's very helpful!Will take a look on there.It makes it harder as she's a sort of friend!I was in shock when she said i was depressed! W as expecting her to say yes it's meno let's talk hrt!

user1484852106,Fri 20-Jan-17 18:53:40,"HelloI'm not sure if this is the right place to talk about my wife and so our menopause journey / problems.For 2 years now my wife has become more and more demanding in all aspects of our lives. She is becoming a monster. When I did some research online I found much to support the idea that ""it's not her fault"" etc. which of course I accept and the general message was to be supportive and loving, which I think I have.I am not a passive person by nature but I made a pact with myself that I would simply try not to do anything to upset her, I would be supportive and I would do pretty much anything she reasonably wanted.I now fear I have created a beast. I love my wife dearly and we have been together 33 years and sure we've had tough times but always got through them, but I fear she is now out of control.Let me explain a bit more. I have done everything I can reasonably do to make her happy, but it now seems I have run out of the ability to please her. She is now saying she still loves me but is no longer in love with me which of course hurts. She is thinking separation might be a good idea, but even my suggestion we take separate rooms was dashed in an instant.For at least the last 3 months we have been more like brother and sister in our day to day lives and intimacy which was IMO always the glue that kept us strong hasn't happened in ages.I fear that in backing down to all her wants and needs has diminished me in her eyes. Not that I have been domineering but I have always made the big decisions. I feel I have given so much of me away that I even barely reconise me, even friends have commented on my passive nature now.She is going to the Dr. next week but in her head she is totally anti HRT because she thinks there are too many dangers associated with it and any suggestion on my part that she might think about it is me with ""its my body"" type comments.At the moment a big part of me feels I or she should just go, we have the option as we have another home, but I am simply not a quitter.I know everyone and couple in the menopause is on a different journey but I would really value some feedback. I don't want to talk to friends as we share the same friends and TBH I feel that really they can't be objective because the are in the middle and I can't see any worthwhile outcome. Plus I am ashamed to admit that we are having these problems. I feel so alone in this. Maybe our marriage has come to an end in her eyes, but I don't feel this, but I have said to her to think very carefully about what she wants because she might not like it when she gets it. Which is what I have read so many times in my reading.Also I think she drinks way too much which can't help. Often getting through 1 + bottles of wine a night. She is on a whole raft of anti angsiaty (sorry can't spell it) medication for most of her adult life, she also has the increasing pressure of an aging and more demanding mother, and her brother who was coles by and helped in this has moved away only coming back monthy, if that. She is half way through an OU course and is beginning to struggle. She generally has no motivation, she is neglecting the house, I can't remember the last time she cooked, all she seems to do is play candy crush etc. I genuinely think she is depressed and is focusing me as the cause. Oh and to cap it off nicely she had her first panic attack in a supermarket in several years.When the menopause started she became really strong and capable and I admit at first it was hard to adjust, but all this seems to have gone out of the window, its like she's had a high and now the low is here.Sorry for rambling. Am I alone in this? I would love to hear both genders views. I'm not looking for solutions, just answers and to know I'm not alone.K"
Shallishanti,Fri 20-Jan-17 20:51:55," I think you're right, she probably is depressed and should see a GP and discuss everything, as PPs said, many women have to cope with menopause plus family issues and it can be hard but doesn't necessarily go like this. Other than that, have you thought about Relate? I think they have resources on their ws that you can look at without going to face to face sessions."

PacificDogwod,Fri 20-Jan-17 22:36:51,"Actually, on rereading your OP, she sounds depressed.What has her GP said?Has she been to see a doctor?Is she happy how things are going?Does she think her body changing is the issue?"

PollyPerky,Sat 21-Jan-17 08:17:10,"Not sure why this guy is being given such a hard time or why some posters are so quick to denounce the role women's hormones can play in a relationship.If a man posted saying he was worried about his wife's PND, or his DD's puberty and hormonal ups and downs, would posters be so churlish?Not saying her menopause is the sole issue here, but it's a challenging time for many women. Seems a bit ironic that so many women post here about feeling anxious, depressed, gone off sex etc due to peri meno then when a guy comes along and says his marriage is in trouble partly due to this, he gets shot down!"

reup,Mon 23-Jan-17 08:36:22,I'm 50 and have had regular periods until Sep last year when they've gone 8 weekly. (I still get the pain at the 4 weeks mark).I've had a lot of symptoms for a while and tentatively mentioned it to the GP who totally ignored me. So I want to go back and be more assertive - am thinking of changing surgeries anyway. My current symptoms areDepression - hopelessness like permanent PMTMood swings - sudden rages Occasional sweating at night (I wake up wet in the morning)Waking at 4am and not getting back to sleep Tiredness (probably due to early waking!) Some knee painHair thinning I'm also overweight with well controlled type 2 diabetes (am in metformin). Would HRT help?Thanks - I keep googling the symptoms of menopause but get so overwhelmed by all the different websites and don't know where to start as it all seems so miserable!
Idefix,Wed 18-Jan-17 09:00:27,"Sorry, I think this is going to be long...I started bleeding at the beginning of December and was referred to gynae at the end of week 3. I had bloods and internal scan and was told that I was perimenopausal - my oestrogen levels are dropping and my progesterone levels were very low. I was also told I had two small intramural fibroids and that endometrium was very thick (on the scan there was only a tiny empty space).I was referred to hospital gynae and had a hysteroscopy and d&c and the bleeding has now stopped  and no malignancy was found in the biopsies.I was then seen for review by the outpatient gynae and we discussed results and options. Hospital gynae has recommended oestrogel as I am going to have a posterior Recotcele repair in a few weeks, he also advised that I am not suitable for a mirena coil. When I asked about hrt my outpatient gynae suggested I just carry on with tranexamic acid for the bleeding...From my understanding I may end up with the hyperplasia coming back? And that this increases my risks of eventually having malignancy? Will still to continue with symptoms of perimenopause - sleeplessness, hot flushes, intermittent low mood and irritability that I have been experiencing for the last 6mths since my periods started to go awry.I am 44 and the thought of having years of these symptoms till I am menopausal is making me feel utterly depressed.I would love some words of wisdom "
PollyPerky,Wed 18-Jan-17 12:01:46,I'm sorry you have had some rubbish treatment!GPs - or any dr- are not allowed to prescribe oestrogen of any kind in a woman with a uterus unless they also prescribe progestogens- it's against licensing rules. The stats say that after 12 months of oestrogen-only HRT (for women with a uterus) hyperplasia occurs in 20% of women and something like 2% is cancerous. (Don't quote me on the 2nd figure- it's a while since I looked.)I don't think nurse practitioners are the best in these cases! heard of so many wrong decisions via forums.Just clarify one thing- the Oestrogel is in a 64 application pump. They aren't talking about Ovestin which is a very weak oestrogen cream used for vaginal atrophy? Once we had a poster who was prescribed Oestrogel for vaginal use (by a hopeless GP) who didn't know the difference.
GoodyGoodyGumdrops,Mon 02-Jan-17 14:56:48,"Definitely find another dr,Ferris. I had one tell me I was depressed. Mood swings, OK, but since when did depression give you hot flushes? I started peri-meno at about 41, went to the GP at 42, 6months of tests and trialing a different treatment, then started HRT just before 43. Probably passed menopause by now (50).GP explained that, for early meno, HRT was essential to reduce osteoporosis - I will have 10 years more bone loss otherwise. But for a regular menopause HRT was about how you are coping. If it makes your life easier, then take it. If you don't feel you need it, then there's no reason you have to take it (unless you have osteoporosis or a family history of it, or some other relevant conditions)."
AlwaysHopeful,Wed 11-Jan-17 12:43:19,"I thought I was depressed. Maybe it is peri though.... I don't get the sweats, but the anxiety, dread, dizziness, swirly shapes going past my eyes (the migraines previously mentioned)... all match up. Dr did blood test 12 months ago. It said all was fine but I've been far from fine..."
PollyPerky,Sat 07-Jan-17 16:46:30,"what dose of HRT are you on?Unless you are depressed it's not recommended (by NICE) to take ADs now for menopausal symptoms. What's the thinking behind Venlafaxine?Your Gp was a bit out of order giving them to you just for flushes, because as you are very young for menopause you probably need a high dose of estrogen (2mgs) and no ADs."
GoodyGoodyGumdrops,Sat 03-Dec-16 10:59:57,"The blood test may need to be repeated. When I began peri at same age as you, my periods were all over the place and my FSH levels varied widely from blood test to blood test. One GP was convinced I was not menopausal, but depressed. Fortunately another GP was willing to look at the picture over several months, rather than as a snapshot of one moment in time.I also had US scans to check my ovaries and uterus before GP would prescribe HRT.Because of the tendency to forgetfulness definitely a good idea to have a written list with you."
Draylon,Fri 06-Jan-17 13:34:51,"I am probably pretty average as a MP patient exploring HRT; 54 years old, 2 years in full MP, hot flushes that can drench me; very poor sleep; am often itchy; libido shot; no real mood swings, just generally a bit low (whereas, formerly, I could get enthusiastic much more readily - I just can't be bothered right now!), so feeling a bit washed up and that life is just one long hassle!I wouldn't say I was depressed, but I do feel my life-long, low level (undiagnosed) anxiety has ramped up over the last few years.Supportive though slightly clueless DH, 2 older teenage DSs.I am overweight (1.5 to 2 stone, with one of those stones coming on since MP...); eat reasonably well, drink 'within guidelines' , and have recently restarted treadmill power-walking every day, and have been trying to improve my diet more.I have an active PT HCP job.I have no medical history of note, or significant FH; good blood pressure results, am on no medications.I wrote this on an earlier post re: my insomnia, but thought I'd paste it here:""I am nervous in that I might find myself walking out the surgery door with a 'come back in 6 months if you don't feel better'; clutching a googled, printed off sheet suggesting I 'sleep in a well ventilated room on cotton sheets/drink lots of water/ exercise at least 30 minutes a day/ eat well/ drink moderately' etc etc - like I don't already try and do my best to stay reasonably healthy when faced with little time, a demanding, stressful job, teenagers on the cusp of Life Choices and needing to sleep on my days off in order to cope. And I'd cope better, maybe be more mindful and less stressed and desperate if I wasn't so bloody tired!""What should I say to the GP (who I barely see so don't know) to 'encourage' them to see that I don't want fobbing off? I read time after time on this forum of women who aren't getting a great service from their GP, and I want to try and pre-empt that. My group practice GP surgery is a bit hit and miss, they do seem keen on making you prove your medical problem by having to make appointment after appointment for the same thing til they'll refer you on. I can't afford the time to make endless appointments and attend them, resulting in chronic sinusitis leading to saline sprays  and me giving up trying to get an ENT referral, but taking up to 2 weeks off work per year with it, in 3 or 4 blocks for about 5 years. Yes I tried 'going back', but because it'd been a year since my last visit, we were back to 'trying saline nasal sprays'.. Anyway.She may give me choices re type of HRT- where do I research which might be best for me? Should I have to do that?I know there isn't a single answer, but I guess I'm asking what brand of HRT would someone like myself expect to walk away from the chemist, clutching, in the first instance?TIA"

80sWaistcoat,Mon 28-Nov-16 12:16:29,I could have written your post 3 years ago - DH and I were heading to divorce because of my unpredicatable mood swings - there was a time when I was 'that' close to throwing a really heavy pan at him...NICE guidelines suggest that Antidepressants shouldn't be the first choice of treatment in perimenopause. www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng23/chapter/recommendationsWhat helped me was HRT - then the pill because HRT made me depressed. I felt an immediate reduction in the rage and the anger and anxiety. What also helped was Agnus Castus for the mood swings. the loss of oestrogen was causing the issues for me - replacing the hormones really helped.
Badders123,Fri 02-Dec-16 19:37:56,I would have no issue taking ADs if I were depressedBut I'm notI'm peri menopausal and having lots of nasty symptomsI'm treating that because 44 is too young to feel like this!
elektra3,Sat 23-Apr-11 08:06:22,"I did a search on the internet for known relief of menapause related symptoms and Serenity Cream seems to pop up everywhere. I wanted independent reviews on the cream and this site came up.I'm 53 and have recently started experiencing regular night sweats. Not full sweating, just hot flushes (I also get 1 before my period, which I still have regulary). I have been under a lot of stress and this seems to have triggered these regular episodes. I'm losing sleep which is beginning to make me feel depressed and moody. None of these things are a good combination for dealing with stress. Izquierda, I also get recurring Cystisis and never connected it with menapause. The countless times I have seen my GP about this because the sachets just don't work for me, and I've never been told that this could be a symptom of menapause. Based on what I'm reading here, paying £17.50 for a cream that appears to have more negative than positive reviews will not be the right option for me. I'm not saying that it's a hoax, there's just not enough conclusive evidence that this cream works."
Momos,Thu 14-Feb-13 16:06:46,"I've been using it for 3 weeks now and it's amazing, I'm 45 and suffered badly from hot flushes during the day and was being woken 4-5 times a night with sweats, I've been having 2 menstrual cycles a year. I noticed results from day 1 when I felt a flush coming but didn't amount to anything and had a sound full nights sleep. I have had no flushes or sweats since. This cream has given me my normal life back, I'm less tired and depressed due to the lack of sleep I was having and no more uncomfortable hot flushes.....so glad I found this cream."
Jazzyjue,Sun 10-Jan-16 19:51:37, I also have had a year of absolute hell I'm 55yrs and menopause hit me like a brick in the head i take 2mg of Progynova and have done since I was 34 after hysterectomy I've had severe depression severe anxiety suicidal thoughts hot flushes no sleep sweating at night omg I've driven my family crazy I take venlafaxine for depression but one night I was on the internet and Serenity kept popping up so I sent for it I've used it for 3 days morning and night I've started to reduce my hrt to 1mg and I don't know if it's placebo but I feel really good honestly I'm not big on these reviews but Serenity is great I see my dr on 18th Jan 2016 so I'm going to ask her what she thinks but up to now I feel like Me Again pray it continues because I will be gutted it's really saved my life x
80sWaistcoat,Mon 14-Nov-16 11:43:11,"Yep, GPs can be crap about the menopause. The NICE guidelines are really helpful as is the Menopause Matters website. Be persistent...For 'the rage' my GP suggested Agnus Castus tablets - which have proved surprisingly good. I definitely felt more even when on the pill as well which was providing oestrogen. Come off it though as was getting v depressed on progesterone days."
80sWaistcoat,Mon 21-Nov-16 19:19:03,"South of France is quite ice free...Menopace, Agnus castus and the pill to supply dome oestrogen, it helped. Started peri about 36/37. 47 now and have come off pill to see if periods have stopped so I can just take oestrogen. I'm a bit progesterone intolerant...Taking stuff to help with menopause helped, I'd have happily taken HRT but it made me quit depressed so has to find something else. Good luck. I'm sure there'll be someone else sling with advice. Something like hypnosis might help too."
weller7104,Thu 29-Nov-12 22:37:14,"hi last October after months of waking up in a start, covered in sweat, 3 or 4 times a night, desperate urge to have a wee for a few minutes,then waking up feeling exhausted when my alarm went off, I decided something had to be done. Like others have mentioned here I had sworn that I would never take HRT, but I felt like a zombie, no energy, just not me. After just one week I felt like my old self full of energy, all day flushes gone and night sweats down to one a night. I'm 48 and intend to wean myself off HRT in next year or so but the few times I've cut down to one tablet every couple of days the symptoms return. I have put on a bit of weight but don't know if its the hrt or just middle age spread. Anyway if I had to choose between weight gain, and a slight increased risk of cancer I'd still choose hrt over the terrible, depressed way I felt."
carole1910,Sat 05-Jan-13 13:37:03,"Have been on kliofem for 10 days now again (was previously on for 3 years and stopped suddenly last Oct to see if Menopause over - i am 54) but really bad hot flushes and night sweats came back within weeks. No effect at all at the moment positively - feel very angry and depressed and my calves ached like hell the first few nights, but that is thankfully gone. I am so anxious for this to work again and afraid it may not now as reading others stories it seems to have kicked in very quickly if it is going to. Will keep you informed for help of others like me. Just had conversation with a friend who is one of these saints that ""put up with it without any chemicals"" - she would never have done so if it was so bad. I have severe sweats - I mean pouring sweats which I have to towel off - about every hour or so day and night. These are followed by a few minutes of shivering and cold - it helps to towel the skin as wet skin will cool quicker I am told, and that has worked a bit for me. It wakes me up and I have then to drink a little and almost always have to have a pee. My husband has witnessed that I have hardly any sleep and about 4 am I just give up and read my book. I hope this is going to work but still feel a failure for not persevering as many other saintly women have! I do feel, however, that given this severity most women would not have seen it through. Everyone is different and it is not helpful for others to make us feel like failures!"
Irishgreyeyes,Wed 30-Jan-13 23:21:04,"Hello Ladies. What a wonderful, hopeful thread. I have been trying to find help for my severe and extreme symptoms. I have all listed and then some, very strange and unpleasant sensations (prickly skin, feeling like I want to climb out of my skin. I've been trying different hrt therapies for two months. I got some help from the Climara Pro Patch. After three weeks on the only strength and no significant relief so my doc put me on double dose five days ago. My mood is better, it was suicidal before, and that is a Godsend. But I'm so hot and chilled all the time. Inside its like a motor whirring and my sleep is hopeless. I seem to be one constant hot flash and chill. Does anyone know how long before a dose adjustment will kick in? I notice my prickles and burning skin are a lot less. Thanks so much! Hugs!"
Fergusmum,Fri 08-Feb-13 22:21:58,Missbopeep - thank you for your encouraging words. well hurrah and hallelujah - phoned gp on wed pm as by this time was feeling suicidal. And yes he had not realised the AD's needed to be tapered off. Put me back onto one of them which I will reduce over time. Had an excellent night's sleep with only one mild hot flush. Just goes to show how potent these AD's are as just after 12 hours all symptoms had gone - and flushes are now very very minor so obviously new hrt is starting to work very quickly as discussed previously on this forum.
oscar2tia,Sun 29-Sep-13 18:48:27,"Hi, been reading all the threads on how ladies feel and I have just started taking Prempak-2. Have to say it is very comforting to know that in the very very early hours of the morning when you are wide awake, that you are not alone. I have felt pretty near suicidal, not so much with the hot sweats, but mentally in a very dark place. Sex is a distant memory. I used to run a lot, now barely have energy to walk a few miles. Prempak 2 does not seem to be prescribed that much from what I have read so far. Are you still in a good place?"
MissMartian,Tue 15-Oct-13 20:45:55,"I just started HRT today, femoston 2/10. I didn't know what was wrong with me I was so depressed for the whole of the last period. I'm 46 and have had symptoms since I was 41, I actually thought I was probably through the worst of it. A few years ago I had dreadfully heavy periods. Now they are more manageable but every 21 days! My life is quite stressful and to top it I was temping. Temping is probably the very worst thing to be doing, because the hot flushes, brain fog and anxiety make it difficult to learn a new job. Really I was learning a new job every week I worked!!! Last June and July I felt really on top of the world, periods getting lighter, I thought, hey I must be over the worst! But then I started to get nervous and flushie, then lack of sleep, no energy. So I wasn't sure how much was lifestyle stress and how much was the menopause. But I took a few weeks off, couldn't work and things have just been getting worse. It's really sad, at this stage when I am reasonably young, so fit I have a 6 pack, only my 13 year old daughter still at home. Instead of enjoying anything, I'm so sick. Anxiety, hot flushes, hardly able to string a sentence together, sooooo tired and miserable. Instead of feeling, bright, intelligent and a little bit funny, I feel dead. Even yesterday when I somehow gathered myself together and crawled to the doc's I'd a hot flush that lasted the whole appointment, at least she could see it first hand!! Now it's only 8 o'clock in the evening and I've been dying to go to bed since 4pm. How can I have a career and a life with this? I heard it said that menopause is easier with a husband. Well I wouldn't fancy my chances meeting a nice man to marry right now. It's strange how many people have been telling me I'm too young to be going through it, yet lots of ladies here are fairly young, around 41-43, same as when I started. If this HRT doesn't work, could someone just shoot me."
oscar2tia,Tue 29-Oct-13 20:21:47,"Is it me , or has anyone else felt so depressed? I'm still trying out the prempak but going back to gp next week. Life just doesn't seem worth living. The one thing I thought was solid (my marriage), now seems uncertain. Anxiety levels are through the roof. Can anyone offer any advice or suggestions. My problems seem to be more psychological than physical."
Hotpink2,Sun 16-Feb-14 20:27:20,"I am new to this form, thanks to everyone who has posted on here. My life has been miserable over the last 2 years, I was diagnosed with Crohn's in 2004 after given birth to my second child. Crohn's was getting really bad and I was in a lot of pain on different medication, steriods and infusions but it came to the point I had to have surgery. Had my surgery last October a few complication but hey you have to get on with it, I love life to much to sit and whine about my aches and pains but Wow the surgery along with an autoimmune disease has put me into early menopause I'm 43 and was not ready for this. I'v been through quite a bit medically in the last ten years but nothing like this. My superwoman acts smile and get on with it dosent work. The hot flushes(hot showers more like) lack of sleep and feeling old and depressed its suicidal. I'm at a very low point in my life right now started kliogest 2mg on Friday it's 3 days now and no improvement, I need sleep, taking sleeping pills stilnoc 10mg and still night sweats wake me up. Help."
lightenupjacq,Mon 14-Apr-14 15:57:01,"wow, reading all of this is a double edged sword. On the one hand Im relieved, like most of us, to know im not alone in this menopausal experience. On the other - well considering the severity of our symptoms its just dreadful that its all so hush hush that few of us knew what it would be like. Its hard to believe that mature women all through history have been dealing with this so quietly... what an indictment of society that it cant be discussed, and of course with youth being all that matters in the media then women are trying harder than ever i suppose to hide it. But gee, I can cope with all these hot flushes - have had them every 20 minutes of so for 4 years, but the anxiety and depression and loss of libido are life changing. Not sure Ive felt anything for ages now - quite dead inside - but how strong and nurturing and responsible we are to just carry on looking after those we love because thats just what women do. The hardest thing is trying so had to look and behave normally when I feel as though Im hardly alive most of the time. No symptoms before menpoause, then bang, its like a big part of who you are is stolen. And reading all of this makes me nervous that so many people haven't really had a great improvement. I start this week. however I hope these 2 things might be helpful - I started taking sage last month and its really helped the flushes - worth a try. And last week I started using Garcinia Carbogia (the natural weight loss supplement recommended by Dr Oz) and for the first time since menopause began I havent felt depressed or anxious! I just now went back to a website discussing its health benefits and found that it actually lists ""boosting serotonin levels"", so I'd HIGHLY recommend that too for the depression. No libido but at least I feel balanced and calm. Best wishes everyone."
Shareaproblem,Tue 11-Nov-14 15:33:44,"I'm a 48 year old lady that obviously didn't know enough about the menopause went to the doctors 2 months ago told him I was having sweats night/day couldn't sleep for more than 2 hours and I could actually feel my moods changing but also told him I had a really stressful job and had given up smoking 6 months earlier and asked if there was a test to confirm the menopause he said no and I ended up walking out with a leaflet!!!2 months later I feel near suicidal, and my mood swings are going to get me in trouble at work, not good emotions to have in a managerial position, as I have no idea if I'm going to be In tears, happy, or going to walk away from my life and everything in it.After reading all these threads what I now know is that I'm not alone, there's more to the menopause than hot flushes and us ladies should talk about it more openly I was also one of those lady's that thought that when the time came I would do it the natural way ha ha I didn't know then what I know now so after being in floods of tears explaining all my feeling to a female doctor this morning she's prescribed a 3month HRT course (which one I don't know I was feeling so horrifically depressed I didn't read the prescription) I'm just hoping it's all it's made out to be and I have a quick response to the drug as I don't think I can go back in to work until my head is in a more stable place so I. Watching the clock now waiting to pick up the prescription"
80sWaistcoat,Thu 17-Nov-16 13:14:12,"www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng23 I had some very teary, anxious and wanting to jump under a bus times in perimenopause. My GP put me on HRT initially but while helping with other things I was still getting v depressed, I moved back on to the pill - one which is supposed to mimic the natural cycle - and that was working well for me mood wise - but over the past few months the depression has come back when I was taking the progesterone back. That is quite common apparently. So I've now come off the pill - and waiting really to see what my hormones are doing before going on to probably an HRT patch. I think what I'm trying to say is that the oestrogen dropping made my moods drop drastically - the pill helped me - and you might need to try a few things. Go back to your GP or ask for an alternative one. It's horrible - but with me it passed - I feel much better now - almost back to my old self again."
tass1960,Wed 16-Nov-16 18:20:43,"I can't explain it - it's a constant feeling of ""nervousness"" knot in stomach, quick breathing until I take some deep breaths, being really aggitated by loud noises (or any noise) - I work in a small open plan office. On the whole we respect that we need to be aware of other people and keep our voices to an acceptable level - except for the person who sits behind me!! Add to this that her assistant is off long term sick and this loud person has just been so unreasonable and demanding (of me) - she has been spoken to by my line mamager but now it's all a bit awkward which doesn't help my feelings of ""nervousness"". Her assistant is due back next week but on a phased return so that should lighten the load a bit. It's kinda obvious where my problem lies when I write this all down.With regard to HRT I was always going to change to the cyclical one and that was why I was at my GP this morning - we were chatting about my low mood and feelings of anxiety and she was trying work out if I am depressed. I don't think I am. From your previous advice and from researching on Menopause Matters I had finally felt able to be a bit more forceful re the type of HRT I wanted to be using. You might remeber that she has been reluctant to prescribe the cyclical one. (Or not since you give loads of good advice on this topic). I've been home for an hour and am slowly losing the knot in my stomach. I will give it a week or so and see how I feel. It's exhausting feeling like this constantly. It's also slightly embarrassing when my eyes well up at the slightest thing."
Cherubneddy1,Sat 24-Sep-16 20:48:08,"I took fluoxetine for about 3 years for PND. It took me ages to get off it once I was no longer depressed; anxiety, agitation and night sweats. The night sweats were bad to begin with ( I am peri-menopausal) but have eased off, so not sure if it was just a withdrawal symptom. I'm thinking of going back on the fluoxetine though, to deal with the joint pain, etc.Oh, and the nausea/ digestive problems stop after a few weeks on fluoxetine."
runningnic,Wed 02-Nov-16 19:47:00,"Hi all, I too have been losing hair - prob for about 7 years, but much worse in the last 3. It is a little sporadic, but at worst, i can lose 100+ whilst having breakfast - they just float onto my shoulders - then more if I wash it and another 100 + when I dry it. I have become obsessed with it and thats how i know the exact amount of hairs lost - one day 432! It has affected my life in a huge way - I used to love having a shower and washing / drying my hair and heading out for the day feeling fabulous....now, I dont wash it for 4 days, tie it back and watch the wispy little stragglers flap hopelessly in the wind. I am trying to find a job, but another part of me doesnt want one as \i then have to worry about what the bl**dy hair is going to do each day. I need to get a grip. Been to docs, had all the tests and nothing came up. Saw dermatologist, nothing. Just had all bloods re-run yesterday so will see what it turns up.One thing I have been using is Viviscal tablets - my skin and nails are looking great, and the remaining hair feels stronger, but there is still shedding. I am 44 and Peri-menopausal........the joys! I totally empathise with you all x"

Some thoughtless fucking woman at my dance class gleefully informed me that I was at risk of cancer when I was discussing my patches with a third party in the loos.I turned round and said that I wouldn't be here to even get cancer without the patches. I was seriously depressed by my menopausal symptoms before starting HRT and it's managed to pull me out of there."

PollyPerky,Sun 16-Oct-16 20:19:46,"If you are really suffering then why not consider HRT?It has a good safety profile despite the alarmist headlines. If there is no medical reason why you can't use it, it will help. And it's best started early (for safety reason) rather than years after the menopause.Gps have been told by NICE not to prescribe anti depressants for the menopause. They can also have serious side effects and NICE describes them as 'having no place in menopausal treatment' unless women are depressed."
slowandfrumpy,Fri 30-Sep-16 22:09:17,"Dear All,I wondered if anyone had found that during the perimenopause they suffered from a crashing lack of confidence. It has come upon me suddenly the last two years. I find that I don't trust my own judgement anymore and as a result have found myself in two bad business situations (I felt that the people I was working with were highly ineffective, but instead of blaming them, blamed myself and kept apologising: one of them subsequently went bankrupt and the second cost loads of money and didn't deliver, so my instincts were right). I feel ugly and frumpy and invisible, and not good enough. But not good enough on quite a profound level; I feel as if it makes sense that I don't have a partner because I'm unattractive and who would want me. And yet, I know intellectually rI'm not worse than anyone else who HAS found a partner. In the last two years three of the closest people to me, who have been single for years, have also found partners, and it makes me feel even more freakish. I have a lovely family, and an excellent and happy relationship with my children. I don't have any big problems. But I don't feel like myself. Also, for the first time in years, I feel a bit lonely. And it makes me sad that I a single and have been for so long, and that my body is withering on the vine before I've had a chance to share it with someone (I've been single for years now). I feel a bit sorry for myself and that hasn't happened to me... ever before. I've noticed that my close friend who is also going through the menopause has also become highly anxious recently and occasionally depressed, so I'm wondering:could this be related to hormonal changes.and is HRT likely to make any difference?"
AndreaJane11,Fri 14-Oct-16 19:54:06," Peri and menopause can be hard work. I am 48 and I am in peri. We have estrogen receptors all over our body and when we get older and our hormones get low and unbalanced it can create anxiety, feelings of depression and lack of confidence. I have felt this also. I try and eat a good diet with fruit and vegetables and not much bread. Also no sugar. Sugar can make you depressed. I like Maca powder which is a superfood to help with hormone balance. I take fish oils and high strength evening primrose oil which helps with mood. Clary Sage essential oil helps with hot flashes and you will feel more relaxed using it too. Hope that helps you"
vintagefiend,Wed 18-Nov-15 14:23:23,"Hello, I'm after information re qlaira and/or femoston for perimenopause/pmdd.I'm 44 and have had the most awful year due to hormonal shifts, primarily related to periods: week of anxious hell prior to period, then severely depressed mood during and for a couple of days after- which doesn't give much time for any normal days. I'm so fed up and very fatigued to boot.I tried oestrogel 2 to 3 pumps daily but that possibly augmented symptoms- certainly it didn't help and i was still having my cycle- i was hoping it would switch me off- ironically i may not have taken enough to do that but i really can't face experimenting any more with oestrogel!I've had zoladex injections which put me into a chemical menopause and the resulting depression was crippling- certainly it got rid of the pmdd as no cycle and stopped feeling ragey but the depression has been far worse (i'm still waiting for it to wear off- tho i'll prob have major pmdd when it does!)- i was using oestrogel once again for addback hrt but it didn't cut through the depression.I've seen a gynae and he's suggested ssris (anti deps) taken for the two worst weeks of my cycle. i'm happy to do this to start with as i definitely need to feel a bit better before i start thinking about hormonal treatment- but i would prefer ultimately not to rely on the antideps due to side effects of weight gain, grogginess, possible dependence, no libido etc and a feeling that hormones at least treat the cause not the symptoms.So that's why i'm interested in qlaira, femoston and anything i haven't thought of and would really appreciate some words of advice/experience. Sorry this post is longer than i intended!"
80sWaistcoat,Mon 23-Nov-15 08:31:07,"Hi. There's a lot going on there. Just wanted to say, I'm on qlaira which has stopped low level persistent bleeding and also improved my mood greatly. Went from continual sobbing suicidal mess with peri menopause to only sobbing for a couple of days a month. Result. Tried HRT first (Premarin I think) but that worked for some stuff but still affected my mood adversely. Had to work with GP trying things out. Also on Abby's castus but not sure if that's working on mood or not. I think it probably is. GP suggested that too. Good luck."
CowardlyLyon,Sun 06-Dec-15 18:22:09,"Hi vintagefiend just wanted to let you know you're not alone. I am peri menopausal and for the last couple of years I have suffered with dreadful mood swings, depression and anxiety. I am only okay for about 10 -12 days each month. The anxiety is the worst. I have no appetite, I am tearful and panicky and dread being on my own. But I also feel very depressed, thinking life is pointless and have no hope for anything good happening in the future. At my worst I have broken down in tears to my DH and Mum and it scares me (and them) how low and desperate I feel. But then thankfully it disappears and I feel okay again until the next time.It is really, really bad and I have been to Hell and back with it over the last 2 years. I have tried HRT and then going back on the BCP. Neither really helped. The HRT was too weak and I reacted badly to the synthetic progesterone in the BCP.I am hoping to try 100mg patches (to surpress ovulation) with separate Utrogestan to see if that can control my symptoms.I wish you lots of luck. No one can understand how dreadful hormonal depression and anxiety can be unless they've experienced it."
CowardlyLyon,Mon 07-Dec-15 16:34:26,"It's total crap isn't it? Basically I feel like someone has handed me an anxiety disorder, out of the blue, for no reason. Before this I was Miss Independent and bold as brass. I just cannot believe what I have become over these last two years???At least I am virtually symptom for up to 2 weeks every month though. If I was like this every day 24/7 I would have necked a bottle of paracetamol long before this. On the days when I have the anxiety and depression life really doesn't seem worth living, it's really that bad.I'm like you in that I can only really bear being with my husband and children. Even being with my lovely Mum stresses me out and puts me on edge. But then when the anxiety and depression disappears I am really sociable and love seeing my friends.I can't bear any responsibility either or having to sort anything out. It sends me into a panicky mess and I feel sick and hopeless. I do manage to hold down a part time job but only because I can do it with my eyes shut. I still dread going in though when my anxiety is bad and it's a real battle.Do you and your friend still manage to get some good days every month? Even those with really severe symptoms usually get a good 7-10 days each month.I am 45 now but all this crap started a couple of years ago. For HRT I tried Estradot patches in 25mg and then upped to 50mg patch, with separate Utrogestan for 12 days a month.My symptoms were a bit better on HRT but I was still quite up and down with my symptoms returning cyclically every month. Typically I was crippled with anxiety and very low mood for several days mid cycle, then for several days before my period. Sometimes my symptoms wouldn't appear until the first day of my period and last for a week or so. But it still only made me symptom free for about two thirds of the month, and the bad days were just as bad as pre HRT.I had read that the BCP was better at controlling hormonal anxiety and low mood because it is several times stronger than HRT. Firstly I tried Microgynon, and took the packets back to back as advised by my GP. It seemed to suit me better than HRT, and my mood felt more stable. But it gave me daily brown spotting and although running packs back to back I still had light 'periods' and the anxiety and depression would return with a vengence.So my GP switched me to Marvelon which is meant to not give you the daily spotting as it's more oestrogen dominant. For the first 3 weeks on it I was Heaven. Back to my old self at last, confident and outgoing again. I genuinely thought I was 'cured'. I was so happy.But then I had a brief 4 day break at the end of the first pack (we went away and I forgot to pack the 2nd pack) and the anxiety and depression came back with a vengence again. I started the 2nd pack assuming they'd disappear after a few days. But 2 weeks later I was still anxious and depressed and it felt like it was getting worse, not better. In the end I broke down in tears to DH because I felt so low and desperate. It scared me how dreadful I was feeling. I knew there was a good possibility that I was having a reaction to a build up of the synthetic progesterone in Marvelon having taken it continuously for over 5 weeks with just a 4 day break. So I stopped taking it.My mood started to lift within 24 hours but then really crashed again just a day later. In desperation I saw my GP and he suggested I try Mirtrazapine which is an AD that's good for anxiety. Funnily enough as I left the GP my mood started to lift again and I realised my period had started. Not sure if that had been the cause of the awful couple of dips?Sadly Mirtrazapine didn't agree with me. I was fine at first, but then started to feel jittery and wired on about day 5. My sleep was iffy too. Then on day 9 I had quite a nasty panic attack. The only other time I have ever experienced a panic attack was when I tried Sertraline a couple of years ago, and I had to stop it too after a month because it sent my anxiety through the roof and I wasn't sleeping. I don't think this was a coincidence that it happened again on Mirtrazapine? So I don't think ADs are right for me.So I am just waiting to see my consultant in a week. I am tempted by either a 100mg patch with separate Utrogestan, of whether to try Qlaira because I do feel I improved a lot on the BCP but just couldn't tolerate the synthetic progesterone.Sorry, that turned into an essay!"
vintagefiend,Wed 18-Nov-15 14:23:23,"Hello, I'm after information re qlaira and/or femoston for perimenopause/pmdd.I'm 44 and have had the most awful year due to hormonal shifts, primarily related to periods: week of anxious hell prior to period, then severely depressed mood during and for a couple of days after- which doesn't give much time for any normal days. I'm so fed up and very fatigued to boot.I tried oestrogel 2 to 3 pumps daily but that possibly augmented symptoms- certainly it didn't help and i was still having my cycle- i was hoping it would switch me off- ironically i may not have taken enough to do that but i really can't face experimenting any more with oestrogel!I've had zoladex injections which put me into a chemical menopause and the resulting depression was crippling- certainly it got rid of the pmdd as no cycle and stopped feeling ragey but the depression has been far worse (i'm still waiting for it to wear off- tho i'll prob have major pmdd when it does!)- i was using oestrogel once again for addback hrt but it didn't cut through the depression.I've seen a gynae and he's suggested ssris (anti deps) taken for the two worst weeks of my cycle. i'm happy to do this to start with as i definitely need to feel a bit better before i start thinking about hormonal treatment- but i would prefer ultimately not to rely on the antideps due to side effects of weight gain, grogginess, possible dependence, no libido etc and a feeling that hormones at least treat the cause not the symptoms.So that's why i'm interested in qlaira, femoston and anything i haven't thought of and would really appreciate some words of advice/experience. Sorry this post is longer than i intended!"
Mrskeats,Fri 30-Sep-16 17:06:07,This may have been done to death but I thought I would check with you lot.I'm 50 and having just a few periods a year after previously being very regular.My question is whether it is normal to feel all over the place emotionally? I can be happy one minute then tearful the next for no apparent reason. I am in a very happy relationship for the last 18 months and other things in my life are good so I'm not depressed or anything.Its disorientating and my partner gets worried thinking I'm not happy with him which is far from the truth.Any ideas on anything I could do/take to help?Thanks
intheknickersoftime,Thu 29-Sep-16 23:28:33," I woke up last night, so hot. Went downstairs at 1 in the morning and started cleaning everywhere because the cat had been sick. I have not really stopped all day. This is so unlike me. It's nearly 11.30and I'm still wide awake. I've just turned 46. I have just managed to wean myself off sertraline for context but don't feel depressed at all. It was the right time for me to stop and am feeling very happy. Wtf going on? I normally want to shooze all the time!"
GlomOfNit,Thu 29-Sep-16 19:33:27,"I'm 43, think I'm in early perimenopause. The last 2 or 3 years, my periods have been a bit more erratic and I get this spotting that starts several days before it properly starts IYSWIM, it spots for 4-5 days then stops, then period starts a couple of days later. Annoying but ... and then a couple of months ago, on holiday, I had odd breast sensations and then pain, and managed to pump out two periods within 24 days, including all the bleeding (so cycle was about 19 days I think) and that included weeks of spotting. Thought I had something sinister going on with my cervix but I had a fine smear test a few months earlier. Breast pain was bad enough to take analgesia for, and I took to GP on my return, who referred me to breast clinic for mammogram etc. After a nerve-wracking day, that all turned out fine too. So alongside shorter cycles, lighter periods, extended spotting, breast Stuff and killer PMT, I also have drier hair (like straw  ), more facial spots ffs, fatigue like I'm in the first trimester of pregnancy, occasional night sweats, RAGE, and now more recently, brain fog and extreme clumsiness. Things just slip through my fingers.  I'm constantly misjudging distances, especially when I reach for things with my hands, and I'm dropping stuff all the time. For some reason, I can cope with the rest but this clumsiness and uncoordination is making me really depressed. I feel like I've had a hand transplant.Anyone else get this clumsiness? I haven't taken my collection of symptoms to the GP yet (aside from the breast thing). Wondering what to do next, whether I should be asking for blood tests or advice on herbal supplements."
KathyBeale,Sun 25-Sep-16 18:17:19,"I'm also 42 and have been taking HRT for three months. I've just messed up my prescription and have been without it for three weeks and I feel dreadful. I can't concentrate, my head is foggy, my hot flushes are coming back, I am anxious, angry and irritable, I can't sleep... I was nervous about it and resentful but these weeks of going back to how I was have made me realise how much I need it. I honestly think if I had to feel as bad as I do without HRT for another 10 years I'd be suicidal (and I have never had any hormone trouble - no PMT or anything - and no depression or mental health issues) And that's all before you consider the increased risks that come with an early menopause."
80sWaistcoat,Tue 30-Aug-16 16:49:24,"I'm on Qlaira for peri as HRT turned me into a depressed wreck. Told GP that the progesterone was sending me loopy and that's what he suggested. It is helping in that the depressive episodes are significantly reduced - and I'm more aware of when in the cycle they are likely to happen - so I can be more rational about it. Also, on GPs advice, take Agnus Castus which also helped with moods. I had to try a few things to find something that mostly works - and it's a faff when you are feeling down anyway to keep having to go back. But it is much better. Good luck in finding something that works for you. The power of hormones affecting your body can't be underestimated."
hairypaws,Fri 23-Sep-16 10:00:57,"I was 43 and for me it was such a relief to find out what was happening to me. I didn't need to come to terms with it at all. I was at rock bottom for so long and on antidepressants. I was still having my period as regular as clockwork but I couldn't sleep, had terrible hot flushes, was paranoid beyond belief and very depressed. They only tested my bloods because of the flushes, came back that I was well into the menopause. Started on HRT and have never looked back. My family was complete however and I can understand that still wanting that option would affect you significantly."
80sWaistcoat,Fri 23-Sep-16 05:23:35,"I. Use qlaira, it's pretty good for mr. Was getting v heavy unpredictable bleeding. Now much lighter. Been peri since late 30s, started qlaira 4 years ago at 43 after trying HRT which made me v depressed. Qlaira stabilised moods, controlled bleeding and is generally ok. Also take Agnus castus to help with moods and promensil, no idea if the latter is doing anything! Still got the insomnia as you can see from posting time. Night sweats much better."
