Elvander,Fri 24-Feb-17 20:27:44,"I started taking Sertraline for PND after the birth of my daughter - stayed on them for 6 months, felt better so stopped. This turned out to be a big mistake and 6 months later I was back on the ADs. I've taken them for over a year now and have felt ""well"" for a good 6 months so I decided it was time to stop again.I've been taking 50mg and since this is the lowest therapeutic dose, I was advised by my GP first time round just to stop taking them. I felt pretty miserable for a few weeks, so this time I've halved the dose, with the intention of stopping completely after a month or so. Felt fine for the first week after I reduced the dose, felt nauseous and exhausted for the second week, and now on the third week I'm really struggling. I'm alternating between feeling total RAGE, and feeling utterly overwhelmed and suffocated by my life. This is a million times worse than last time I came off ADs, and I haven't even stopped completely yet!I would be interested to hear other people's experiences of Sertraline withdrawal. I'm hoping that this is just a period of adjustment while my brain gets used to not having as much Sertraline, but part of me is terrified that I've actually turned into this awful, angry, ungrateful person and the drugs have just been masking it... I'm really struggling to cope with everything - it all just feels like too much. I'm not feeling suicidal or anything like that, but I am having random thoughts about running away from it all which I haven't had in a long, long time.Please give me hope that the old me is still in there and this will pass soon!"
colouringinagain,Sun 26-Feb-17 22:59:25,"Hi Neema and LEM so lovely to hear from you.I'm having a complete nightmare at the moment. My 'd'h had a v determined suicide attempt end 2014, and end 2016 a major major psychotic episode where I had to call 999 cos I was scared he'd hurt me. He came out of hosp last Thurs. Staying for a bit with his brother. We're separated. It's horrendous. My lovely dd is having intrusive suicidal thoughts and my lovely ds is very dad and very angry. I hate my oh now but have to spend time with him when this dcs see him, cos ds esp misses him loads. I think a lot of my mh probs have actually been down to living with a bipolar husband who when manic tells me I'm neurotic etc. Have v fond memories of the village. Been nice to spot you on other threads LEM and looking like you're doing lots better x.Sorry other posters don't mean to ignore, just v nice to connect with old friends at such an awful time."
Owlzes,Mon 20-Feb-17 11:04:09,"I know you guys aren't doctors, but I know there are some smart people here and people who have worked with psychiatric services and I’m trying to work out if something is normal.So, I’m diagnosed bipolar, and on medication (lamotrigine and aripiprazole) and have a history of hospitalization, but have been stable for the last 3-4 years. Used to be diagnosed as type one, now type two (because I’ve not had a manic episode in a number of years). I’m on medication and apparently stable. I’ve been going through some stuff lately (parents in law hitting end of life stage, work stress, wedding planning stress, money stress) and it’s felt like it’s getting to me so my fiancé kicked me into talking to my CPN today.I went in and explained that I’d not been sleeping properly lately, that since Thursday I’d been tearful most days, and that on Thursday and Sunday I’d been actively suicidal and making plans to die, including one day on which I acquired the method I was thinking of using (it was an inept plan, in retrospect, but that isn’t the point). I said I felt exhausted and drained and I just wanted to be dead so I could rest, and I felt so very alone. I also said I’d self-harmed for the first time in four years. I also showed her my mood tracker in my diary and how many days I was on a 1 or 2 (I track my moods from 1-10, with 1 being suicidal and 10 being ecstatic).She said “well, that’s normal. You’ve got a lot on. You should try more exercise” and “what’s the point of that mood tracker? How can you track your own moods? You won’t be objective” and pretty much sent me on my way, with this vague sense that I was being whingy and a bit melodramatic. She didn't make another appointment to see me either, so apparently I'm not seeing her again unless I chase, although I'm still seeing my pdoc every four months. I don’t know if maybe I was just coming across as stable (I was freshly showered, with make up and nice work clothes) or it was the very neatly set up bullet journal with stickers and notes, and maybe that does mean I’m OK – her normal line is that if I think I might be unwell, I’m not. But it feels a bit too me as if I’m caught in a catch 22, as either way (either I’m too mad to know I need help, or if I know I need help, I’m not mad enough to get it) I get no support.She’s done this before – in August I had a bit of a wobble where I decided that I was getting messages from Disney songs and just needed to run until I turned into sky – where she said if I could recognize those were odd thoughts then I wasn’t actually unwell – and I’m beginning to wonder if she thinks there is anything wrong with me. Which is OK, if there is nothing wrong with me, but surely none of this is totally normal? Or is it? Am I just being melodramatic?And if it’s not normal, who am I meant to talk to? What am I meant to do? Is there any kind of alternative support structure away from a CPN that isn’t ‘whinging to my friends’? Or should I just get on with it (not the suicide, the gluing myself back together)?Any advice very gratefully received."
StumblyMonkey,Mon 20-Feb-17 18:25:36,"Absolutely not normal.It may be that she's not used to dealing with people who have significant insight into their own condition?I also have bipolar and am able to explain my thoughts and can, if not immediately, relatively quickly spot my own hypomania.I would absolutely change psychiatrists. I would actually raise a complaint once I was well enough - telling someone having strong suicidal ideations that nothing is wrong is frankly dangerous. Do you have private healthcare through work or could you afford a private psych? It's the best thing I've ever done so would highly recommend it if you can (but realise many can't unfortunately)..."
Owlzes,Mon 20-Feb-17 23:24:51,"I called today and asked if I could make an appointment with my pdoc and was told his secretary was away until next week and when she gets back I can make an appointment for the next couple of months maybe. So I gave up and am now asking for an appointment with my GP. I have talked to a friend at work (ironically, I work for a MH charity, and my boss is an ex-psych nurse) and he said she was being useless and I should ask to change CPN but I'm trying to pluck up the courage to get that in motion. I just keep thinking that if I ask to change CPN I'll be told she was right and I'm wrong and there's nothing really wrong with me and I'll be stuck with her with her being even more exasperated with me.I went into work and my boss was lovely and told me to think about whether I needed some time off or to go down to part time hours while I'm unwell. I also slept for a few hours this evening and while I got up feeling slightly giddy, I'm OK. I'm not suicidal right now - just absolutely drained. I know that depression tends to manifest in a very physical way for me - like a weight on my chest or something. And everything feels really really hard. My fiance was lovely and says that he will come with me into the CMHT if I want to make a complaint as he feels quite strongly she's being useless and he's really annoyed about the mood diary comment as he feels it's been staggeringly useful for both of us to be able to follow how my brain is working. I think I'll try talking to the GP on Weds - if I get much worse before then there is A&E. It is just so fucking hard to manage the energy to do all this."
Iris65,Tue 21-Feb-17 14:40:51,"I am really sorry that you are going through this. I have a lot of experience both as MH services user and as a (MH) professional for a period.Apart from the actual diagnosis I am very similar to you - high functioning even when very unwell and often suicidal.It is frustrating when members of the team don't seem to take you seriously but... what are you hoping for?A couple of years ago my SI was taken seriously and I was admitted for a week to an acute psychiatric ward and then endured a month of day hospital. Afterwards I saw the crisis team regularly and realised that:1) Most of the team knew a lot less than me.2) Because the team changed so often there was little continuity3) The NHS could not provide what I wanted - which was long term, high quality psychotherapyand 4) The best person to manage my condition was.....me.Now I have a plan in place for those periods when I am actively suicidal which involves telling my DP how I feel, being nice to myself, spending time with friends even when I don't want to, staying physically active, chanting positive mantras and if that doesn't help I see a private counsellor for a few sessions. Costs about the same as a weekend away. I am lucky because I have met a really good therapist and I can afford it."
Owlzes,Tue 21-Feb-17 15:28:52,"My previous CPN was amazing. Realistically, I think I got a lot of extra attention then because I was fresh out of hospital when I came to her and at first the CMHT wouldn’t take me as I was considered high risk (I had delusions, intrusive thoughts and suicidal compulsions). So they put a lot of work into me.Whereas my new CPN met me when I moved cities, had been stable for a year, and hasn’t really seen me when I’ve been very unwell. Which I sort of logically know. But it’s still a bit sucky.I don’t know. Maybe I do need to just get on with it, in which case I wonder if I’m better off just ditching the CPN and pdoc entirely. Except my GP is twitchy about prescribing my antipsychotics without them and I think I’ll get ill again if I have no meds. Argh! Sorry! I know you’re being helpful. I’m just feeling awful and am fighting the urge to collapse in a nihilistic heap."
OurMiracle1106,Mon 27-Feb-17 22:05:07,"I suffer from epilepsy. Both absence and tonic clinic seizures. I have absences a few times a week, sometimes it's harmless-watching tele I miss a minute of a programme other times falling down stairs burning myself walking in a road. Apparently I'm safe to go out alone as the absences aren't frequent enough and ""whilst they can understand why I would prefer someone with me they doubt it could cause any anxiety"" despite having been hit by a car lucky to be alive as a result I wasn't awarded either when it was reassessed. On top of that they sent my letter to the wrong address and 3 months later I'm still waiting for my mandatory reconsideration. The assessor came to my home. Was early. Didn't take down all my medications. Wrongly documented my last seizures. Forgot to mention me being around strange men is very hard. (I work in an office of a children's centre there's 2 admins. Both female) due to past experiences. I can manage. Just without it. But I can no longer afford my counselling so it's a matter of time before I end up depressed and suicidal again."
clairethewitch70,Tue 28-Feb-17 20:27:45,"My mental health is plummeting quickly. I have BPD, depression and anxiety. Because of my physical deterioration my depression is suddenly becoming worse.Scared I will become suicidal again, I become impulsive and can go from not suicidal to very, quickly.I am spending more and more time in bed, and when working, I am present in body but not in mind. I am taking the day off tomorrow. We own our own business so I won't get sacked, but obviously work will build up.Several things have caused this flare up. A cold several weeks ago have impacted energy levels, then 3 weeks ago today I had day surgery on my spine. PIP forms have had to be completed (I was on lifetime award DLA), and I am stressed about that.My DH is very supportive, but I know he can only pick up so much slack from me. He has long term health issues too.Hand hold please."
winekeepsmesane,Tue 28-Feb-17 21:50:31,"Hi, sorry, I don't have any advice despite a similar situation, but I wonder what your triggers are? I can spiral within minutes but (luckily I guess) I'm very aware of my triggers and can usually relatively fix things. Do u think that u could fit in another gp appointment? Applying for pip is ridiculously difficult, have u got an advisor to help u? I obviously can't personally help but I really hope u find a way to counteract the suicidal thoughts. I'm well aware that the ONLY reason I've not ever (fully) acted on mine is because I've seen and felt the other side of it. If u ever need to talk to alleviate some symptoms feel free to pm or just talk on here x"
clairethewitch70,Tue 28-Feb-17 22:12:15,"My triggers are usually stress based, and also when my physical health deteriorates. Seeing GP next week, if I ring I can't usually get in with the same GP and don't get the level of support with other Dr's at the surgery.I sent the PIP forms off yesterday, took my over a week to fill in, provided lots of letters which my GP printed off for me, but I am still expecting to lose it. I am not actively suicidal but don't want to go there again. Last time I was taken off a motorway bridge by Police back to MH ward. Thank you wine & nolonger"
Bluefluff,Tue 28-Feb-17 22:16:36,"Hi Claire I have bpd too and know how difficult the extreme and sudden mood changes can be especially when these include suicidal thoughts. So another handhold from me. Have you done any DBT at all? It really helped me with impulsiveness, in particular practising mindfulness. Hope your feeling well soon "
GinAndSonic,Sat 18-Feb-17 21:35:08,"I beleive you. Im so sorry you didn't get the outcome you wanted and that things are so tough for you right now. I never reported my rapes, but I did have rape counselling and it was so helpful. I was referred to them by a domestic violence worker, could one of the professionals you are involved with do the referal rather than you having to self refer? It probably won't speed it up but it takes the pressure off of you needing to make the call. My local rape crisis centre has helpline evenings where you can call to just talk or you can email a dedicated address to just talk, it's not counselling but it's a volunteer listening service. Alternatively maybe samaritans? They have an email service too that I used when supporting a suicidal friend. "
isupposeitsverynice,Mon 20-Feb-17 16:17:47,"Ahh mate. Here, I'll tell you what's wrong with you - some fucking prick violated and traumatised you to a point where you can't have a nice walk up the road without freaking out. It's all on him. None of this is your fault. Just take it slow and steady - you can get through this and you will get through and you'll be even stronger and more amazing than you already are (true story, don't argue, you are great, I know things, me )I wonder about meds and that. I mean obviously for some people they clearly work and that's ace, but for people like you and me I wonder if they really do much? Cuz like, are we depressed as such? Or are we just completely justifiably fucked off and angry because of what's been done to us? Not the same is it, or maybe it is, I dunno. If they help you sleep you're getting some value out of them so that's something? By the way your bathroom plans sound ace, I love the sound of the colour scheme, very cheering. Have you got anything in mind for a treat with your saved up money? I er, accidentally bought some more notebooks while I was out for my (faintly useless) workshop. They've got this gorgeous floral pattern. I am drowning in notebooks tbh. Oh and some cinnamon incense, it smells just like that dentyne chewing gum they used to sell."
Itisnoteasybeingdifferent,Tue 28-Feb-17 22:04:42,"Does sound like you have borrowed my T shirt.. As anxious says, speak to your GP and you will need a referral to a specialist. Then the big question you will have to face is, ""do I want to take the meds?""From personal experience it is not an easy choice to make. Depending on which meds you will be affected to some degree. If they don't do something there is no point in taking them. They may help you manage your emotional excess. But the price is loss of genuine emotion and feeling alive (and depressed). FWIW, I choose to take my meds because I have learned that life is easier whilst medicated than it is when I am blowing over hot and rushing about trying to avoid depression,"
Scribblegirl,Wed 22-Feb-17 18:25:29,"Any other sufferers out there?Sometimes mine is under control and sometimes it's insane. My anxiety is on a flare at the moment and my hands, lips and mouth look appalling from picking and biting at them. I also have a section on my nose I can't stop with, pretty sure my colleagues think I'm a compulsive bogey picker...I really struggle to think of it as a mental health thing. I've had various informal diagnoses between anxiety and OCD in the past (although the best fit for my symptoms I've personally found is borderline) but nothing's stuck and I've usually managed to flit between services without getting sorted. I have moments of proper despair but by the time an appointment for anything comes around I'm coping a bit better and cancel, or feel like a fraud for sitting through the appointment, probably getting labelled a time waster  Despite (or perhaps because of) a couple of suicide attempts in my teens and self harm issues (although I've not cut in a few years and now just scratch myself) I can't see compulsive picking as a 'problem' in the same way. Family and friends just think of it as an irritating habit. When DP and I first met he used to bat my hands away when I started to pick until I told him how patronising I find it. Now he just reminds me to stop - as he knows sometimes it's something I'm doing subconsciously - but that's easier said than done.It's weird, I'm actually feeling on a decent keel at this very second but but I can't stop ripping at my skin. Sigh."
sadandanxious,Mon 27-Feb-17 13:53:24,"I have BPD and the laziness and not parenting really don't sound like typical symptoms of BPD. Either he's slipped back into depression massively or he's using it as an excuse. Honestly I find parenting exhausting when I'm depressed but no matter how shit I feel I would always make sure my DSD is fed, teeth brushed, story read before bed etc. Mind you maybe he is just finding it too much, everyone responds differently. Regardless of his reasons is sounds awful for you! Have you thought about or suggested couples counselling?"
happyfrown,Mon 27-Feb-17 20:40:02,"I am the flip side of your post. I have BPD and ended a long relationship with dp because of it. he was told about my mental health when we met and honestly supported me through thick and thin. but I couldn't stand the guilt of him having to put up with me, im hard to live with to the point I refused him to live with me for the years we were together. your H maybe depressed but even people with bpd / depression still manage to do basic parenting as hard and draining it maybe. are you sure its completely his illness and not part taking the advantage of you?no one can tell you to leave or stay as they are not the ones dealing with the outcome. you have to decide whats best for everyone, if your worried about how your H will care for the dc if you leave is there not a way of seeing through contact centre due to your concern for their safety with his mental health state?"
TerrorTwilight,Mon 27-Feb-17 12:11:26,"Hi everyone. I'm a man. Sorry about that. I hope you don't mind me posting here.I've just returned from a 4 week absence from work. I'm a teacher (a deputy head, actually). Been back a week. Half my issue is I seem to other people to be coping most of the time, but what's under the surface is this boiling terror. I nearly wigged out completely at work this morning and a kind colleague very kindly managed to talk me down again. But nobody else really sees that, and I feel like it makes me seem like a fake. Background: I had a really serious anxiety attack in my previous job back in July. I took a week off work but went back before I was really ready, and feel like I've never properly healed. I have a history of depression; the anxiety is new (or at least newly acknowledged: I think it's always been there).Anyway. My brain tells me I'm not good enough, that I'll be found out, that everyone thinks I'm shit, that I'm letting everyone down. (It doesn't help that my marriage is seriously on the ropes.) When I feel like this I often think everyone would be better off without me around. I wouldn't class this as suicidal, as I don't seriously consider doing anything about it: much too scared to actually hurt myself. But if I were to, like, evaporate painlessly I feel like most of the people in my life would be better off. The only thing that gives me pause is my wonderful daughters, and that stops me from taking that thought anywhere past the initial impulse reaction to my uselessness. I'm a good daddy. I actually do know that. It's the only thing I know.I'm medicated (20mg Citalopram) and having weekly therapy. I do feel better than 4 weeks ago: the flat featureless depression I had (which wasn't the depth of black despair I've experienced in the past) has mostly lifted. But I am very anxious about work, because I loathe it. With a passion.And half of what's scaring me is that I seem to be stuck with one or the other: marriage or work. If my marriage fails, I have to stay in my job to be able to financially support my babies. If I end up having to quit my job, I won't be able to support myself, much less them. It feels like Catch 22. Does it get better? I can't feel like this any more. It's killing me."
W8woman,Mon 27-Feb-17 21:31:41,"Saved my life. I had ADs and every kind of therapy going, privately and on the NHS, and was agoraphobic and suicidal. EMDR gave me the strength to re-build my business in the wake of the recession and start and endure IVF and PND.I was the victim of an armed robbery and attempted rape a week after a bereavement. My assailants have never been caught. I have crystal clear recall, no flashbacks and only a few flash-forwards. I still occasionally suffer OCD anxiety (untouched by the EMDR) but have had that since I was a kid and now think it's just my personality type."
humanfemale,Mon 27-Feb-17 09:44:00,"I think I'm realising that I have slipped from managing to just not any more. Gave up drinking a few months ago for mental health and was prepared for a period of adjustment but think I am just very depressed and need to be on medication for a while.I'm really hoping for some advice on medication. Have triedProzac - made me anxious and insomniaSertaline (sp) - sameCitalopram - made my blood pressure too low and kept faintingMirtazapene - worked brilliantly except weight gain which was unmanageable as I'm someone with an eating disorder Trazodone - made me feel dead inside I can't believe I'm back here again, having to make an appointment to sit across from a busy GP in tears and having them prescribe me the next 'line' of AD and the horrible weeks of adjusting, discovering they are not helping, and weaning back off. Does anyone have any knowledge about maybe some med I could research? I am anxious, been having panic attacks, feel detached and unable to cope, losing confidence, just want to be alone."
alwaysthepessimist,Mon 27-Feb-17 14:28:54,"  I didn't want to read & run, could it be that the setraline just isn't working for you? Could you suggest you try something different? Also when I was depressed and felt very low one of the things my counsellor got me to do (eventually) was to find something that relaxed me, something which took my mind to a different place, mine turned out to be playing 2 games on my tablet - Hay Day & Township - I still play them now - they engross me, when I play them the world seems to switch off around me. I do also enjoy doing the adult colouring but it doesn't relax me as much. Good luck - I hope you get the right answers soon"
Blackbird82,Sun 26-Feb-17 23:35:01," Yep I turn into a depressed, angry, unreasonable, intolerant old boot for about a week to 10 days before my period. As soon as I come on, I'm a different person. It is a constant rollercoasters of emotions. I am trying very hard to keep an eye on how I feel throughout the month and keep a diary to chart my emotions and feelings"
happyfrown,Sun 26-Feb-17 19:34:08,"ive always had mental health issues, I go between hyped up phases, where I make things (projects) buy animals or go extreme on keep fit. then depressed to the point of self harm and not moving all day unless cooking for kids etc.ive made many nice furniture items and my understairs cupboard is full of wood, diy stuff and things ive kept for future projects. my eldest DS is needing a computer table and usually I would build something, the thought didn't excite me like it used to. cupboard has got messy due to not being myself so had to take everything out to check what wood I have to use. I came across things id saved for future projects and most of the wood had bowed and twisted from standing up.I felt overwhelmed with all this mess and stuff I don't have the mental energy for. where as before it was like gold dust, like my treasure! I looked at it all and didn't know how to feel? I actually got quite emotional and wanted to run out the door and leave all I have behind.  last summer I had a melt down (of many) and hadn't touched a tool until last week, yet what I made was done on numb brain cells, i cant get back into anything? even tho I don't have much interest in things and used to hate my extreme phases of 12hr d.i.y ing I feel ive lost the last thing that makes me? I don't think im making much sense, but I feel like im not here anymore like there is nothing to me. don't really know why im writing I guess im self pitying, I used to dance, smile. I used to care .... even with this illness. now there is nothing."
Jayfee,Sat 25-Feb-17 19:16:36,"I am no expert. However, I know that one symptom is feeling that people want to hurt you. I find it hard to believe there is a suicide is your own choice list. Why don't you call Samaritans for advice. You don't have to be suicidal to call them. It might help. You will be doing something to try and help yourself. Good luck."
PooBrain,Fri 24-Feb-17 21:44:30," This isn't a suicidal letter by the way, a genuine request for any information on mental illness/suicide in families for children, if and when. I'm not about to go finish myself now. I'm off to bed with a cup of tea."
PooBrain,Fri 24-Feb-17 22:20:51,"Oh and how self absorbed was I when I thought that the ancient historical power from ancient emperors was emanating from me and so I had to get away from my children because I was going to lead to the American secret service thinking we were a threat to global domination.I could have just chosen to not demand a brain scan from my doctors to prove that I wasn't human. Because mental illness is not like physical illness because it is a rational choice to ruin your (wonderful, stable, married and affluent) life with terror, despair and misery. How self absorbed of me."

NolongerAnxiousCarer,Sat 25-Feb-17 17:46:52,"Huge hugs to you OP, I've been stunned by the level of ignorance shown in some posts. It sounds like you have a really good support network and I hope they can sort your meds so that you can have some stability again soon. When my DH is poorly he is sometimes suicidal, I used to worry about this a lot, but I think now I have come to a point where I accept that it is a possibility and I know that I do everything that I can to support him, therefore if it happens it won't be my fault. I hope it never comes to it, and I know if it did I would be devistated, as I would be by any other cause. I think for me that the thing that has helped the most is seeing his illness as a seperate entity from him. I can get angry at or upset with the illness, not with him. Maybe this would help the kids to cope with their feelings, whenever your illness causes upset to the family (this could be anything from Mummy saying strange things, or Mummy having to go to hospital not limited to the extreme of suicide)I agree with differents analagy of the heart attack. You can know that someone has a heart condition, you can learn first aid and how to handle an emergency. But nothing can prepare you for a fatal heart attack. It is different from terminal cancer where the course of the disease is more predictable and the end inevitable. I think talking to the kids about suicide would just scare them, and not prepare them. I think the best thing you can do is to help them to grow into emotionally strong and confident people. To help them understand that your illness is not you and it is ok to be angry with the illness or upset about it. Let them know its okay to talk about it too and how they feel about it. Help them understand in an age appropriate way, such as Mummy sometimes has nightmares when she is awake, which can make her do strange things.And just keep letting your kids know you love them. I hope you get some stability soon."
NolongerAnxiousCarer,Fri 24-Feb-17 19:11:27, ADs saved my life. As PP said would you feel this way about taking medication for a physical illness? You are not your Mum and I'm struggling to see what ADs would have to do with her getting drunk (though there are some that you shouldn't drink with and alcohol is a depressant so drinking whilst depressed isn't generally advisable)

Wolfiefan,Wed 22-Feb-17 23:11:34, Yep. Depression. Functioning. Wading through treacle. Detached and robotic. Totally was depression for me. I thought it couldn't be. I didn't feel sad. I had nothing to be depressed about. But yep I was depressed.
Rockingaround,Thu 23-Feb-17 00:13:34,"Hi OP I have as depression since being a little girl (I'm currently on 40mg of citalopram and have been for the past 11 years) one of my first realisations/memories of ""the feeling"" was similar to what you describe, a feeling of guilt, like I'd done something terribly terribly wrong, I think I was about 9. Although I've had more than my fair share of knocks and hard times, I experienced those feelings before anything major happened in my life. I firmly believe that for many (not all) people depression is caused by the levels of seratonin our brain produces, for me I just think it's how I'm wired and the pills enable me to live a 'normal' existence. My meds increase the levels of seratonin in my brain thus enabling me to experience the happiness in my life; as opposed to only ever seeing the dark side to life - feeling low, pessimistic, hopeless, etc. It took me a long long time to come to this realisation, I spent my teens and my early twenties in a self - destructive, reckles state tbh - trying counselling, cbt, natural remedies, meditation, courses, excersise etc etc etc. I don't know if anything has happened recently to trigger these feelings for you?Depression is so complex and unforgiving, like I've said, for some of us it just looms.  Is it vaguely similar to when you had PND? And, how did you get through it then? I've never taken Prozac so not sure of how long people are prescribed it..."
Rockingaround,Thu 23-Feb-17 01:00:41,"Thank you OP I think sometimes counselling, CBT and other therapies can help some people, although for many it's just too much, too painful and something many are never ready for/able to do. One of the things that has helped me, is to abandon looking for a resolve, I got to the point where I didn't care why I felt like ill, I just needed to feel better. I found that searching and the going over of my life in therapy just made things worse - I had several therapists - I think I got the point where I thought, even if I understand why I feel like this, I'm still going to feel like this so how do I make it go away. I initially started medication to give me a break from myself/the pain; with a view to get to the bottom of it when I felt stronger. 11 years on, I couldn't care if I never ""work through"" my issues and come to terms with why I have depression. It's quite an empowering place to be, I honestly don't think there's anything wrong with being on (the right) pills forever You sound like there's a lot going on for you at the moment. There's obviously those awful memories from the experiences you've had, the feelings they conjur up which are made worse by the very present effects of the breakdown of a relationship. One compounds the other, I'm terrible if faced with a difficult time, I group all of the bad things that have ever happened to me, along with my fears - together and become enveloped in all that sadness/hopelessness. (I think that's quite typical of a depressive thought process although I only know my experiences) Id be so overwhelmed in your position, by what's happening with your partner, which is bound to dredge up a lot of other negative feelings you've had in the past and it all just piles up too high. I would probably go and see the GP. Don't feel you have to pour your heart out, just tell him/her you have a good insight into your own mental health, you're having an excruciatingly difficult time and you're a mum and you need to feel better than you do. If you want to try and see if meds can give you a break maybe? it's exhausting feeling as you are right now. I think it takes about 3 weeks for an ssri to take effect ..."
AnxiousMunchkin,Sat 27-Feb-16 09:40:25,I'll keep talking to myself. I did a test last night and this morning and both negative. But still no AF. 9 days late now. If this is a side effect of sertraline I'm really worried because I can't be coping with this worry that I might be pregnant every month. But sertraline was the last antidepressant that I was happy to try. Although I'm actually taking it for anxiety. But I will not take paroxetine or fluoxetine again as I became suicidal on them. Citalopram was not effective for me. Venlafaxine worked well I thought but then I overdosed on it and it caused a seizure so I think that's out again now. Sertraline is the only one that the GP offered me that I was happy to try. I expected some side effects but affecting my cycles like this is too much of a worry that its counterproductive if the whole point is to help manage my anxiety. It's so frustrating.
AnxiousMunchkin,Sat 27-Feb-16 10:49:21,"Oh goodness. Hello. I feel a bit embarrassed now like I've been discovered mumbling to myself in a darkened room The plan is to go up to 100mg but my GP wanted to start very low and ease up because of my previous experience of suicidal ideation on some other SSRIs. I realise that GAD would be a diagnosis but I'm not sure if that's my diagnosis IYSWIM. She tends to say ""if"". I'm trying to commit myself to the plan of staying on this for at least a few months at the proper dose to give it a proper try. But I'm worried because I really don't need any other things to fuel anxiety I'm perfectly capable of finding millions of things to worry and obsess about without adding to it! It's confusing though I can't find amennorrhoea listed as a side effect of sertraline. But my cycles have never been disrupted before and I've been going through stress and anxiety for some time. I am worried about developing suicidal thoughts again. I don't have any at the moment. But I have started to think about self harm and that's not something I've done for probably a decade. Just the idea of causing some physical pain as a focus, something real to concentrate on."
Eulalia2,Wed 22-Feb-17 21:35:19," Eldest son has mild autism but has had additional mental health problems for over a year now. His Dad (my husband) died nearly 15 months ago. I am struggling with being on my own with him, age 17, daughter 14 and youngest son 11. This year my mother was also very ill and I had a lot of stress at work. Just had nearly 4 weeks off work with stress/depression and am now taking anti depressants. I managed to summon up a bit of effort to talk to my son at the weekend (been ignoring each other mostly). He revealed he had been cutting himself. He showed me his scars on his arm. They were more like deep scratches. I didnt really look at them properly. For some stupid reason when I saw them I thought ""is that it?' Like thinking they weren't that bad. I felt no other emotion, shock, sympathy or anything. We talked about emotions and he seems to be feeling the same. I didnt reveal my thoughts and didnt really register it until later. I realised that my reaction was not right for a mother. I know I am depressed but really is this the sort of thing people do? I just don't seem to care about anything any more and even worse I don't seem to care that I don't care. It's taken me a lot of effort to even type this."
NolongerAnxiousCarer,Wed 22-Feb-17 21:59:30,"Firstly who knows how they would react to this till it happens, the lack of emotion could be shock in itself. Also when we are depressed we can just feel so numb, that we can't feel anything.For me self harm is a coping mechanism to release the pressure that builds up inside when stress gets too much. Sometimes it can be a way of feeling something when you are feeling too numb inside. The severity of the injury does not necessarily reflect the severity of the emotional turmoil. I rarely break the skin, but the intensity of the urges and the internal anguish is completely unbearable to get me to that point in the first place. Also generally over time you need to cut deeper to get the same relief and it can be addictive.You need to get proffesional help for both of you ASAP. Get youself and your son to the GP and get some help."
Eulalia2,Thu 23-Feb-17 18:27:53," Thanks again will have a look at that link, am far too tired just now, was home late as had training after work and trying not to go to bed too early. I think part of the problem is that I have totally lost perspective, I feel that I don't have any real problems, that I am 'making' myself depressed, I feel guilty and that I don't deserve any attention but at the same time am seeking it... its very childlike. I found myself making attachments to people at work today, the ones that were sympathetic, wanting to be with them. I've never actually told one single professional the whole story of the difficulties of the last 2 years, my dad being ill and dying, then my husband, my son being ill, then my mother, stress at work and trying to run a household single handed (with poor living conditions thrown in - Long story). I just wish I could cry, I've not been able to do that for weeks now."
dangermouseisace,Tue 02-Aug-16 23:34:21, There are some people who get depression from the pill or other drugs- my uncle got depressed on an anti-inflammatory! My friend had to have her IUD taken out because if was affecting her mood. It might be worthwhile using other forms of contraception for a while and see if your mood continues to improve.
showsomeclass,Wed 03-Aug-16 13:00:21,"Thanks guysWhat's silly is that I don't actually use it for contraception as my DP has had 'the snip'! It's for period control, which is works brilliantly for! But oh my days - sometimes I feel suicidal and so out of control of my own feelings"
misiabella,Thu 23-Feb-17 18:31:23," I got so bad on Cerelle that in the end I had very disturbing, and very real suicidal thoughts. I took it for about 8 months and it was hell. Constant spotting was the least of my problems. I was in constant anxiety, I would cry in the car after dropping kids at school, constant fog and inability to gather my thoughts. I had moments wen I was extremely angry and had to really control myself. I was irrational and emotional. I almost divorced my husband. Finally I couldn't even sleep at night as my head was full of anxiety and suicide looked to me like a very tempting option. With the last of my sense I went to gp to change it back to cerazzete which I used to be fine with (before they decided to save some money and changed it to cerelle) The effect of cerelle worn off within a few weeks, but even after the first week the difference was huge. They are supposed to be the same, but there is something in cerelle that gave me anxiety/depression."
mycavitiesareempty,Thu 16-Feb-17 19:27:43,"My kids are too old for rota virus vaccine. They have both had their share of stomach bugs but often these are just 3-4 vomits and then that'sounds it. Sometimes diarrhea too. One of these must have been rota. OP can I gently suggest that you are probably more depressed than you realise. Women, IMHO, can be really quite severely depressed ( and this includes predominantly anious-type depression) while appearing to function. We have to. Do you want to tell us about your life more generally? It'seems a good bunch on here. Lots of people who have been in similar situations send come out the other side."
SloanePeterson,Fri 17-Feb-17 08:36:11," Op, I want to tell you, the you of the future won't recognise the you of right now. The cbt and the tablets WILL help you. I was you 8 years ago. My second child was about 14 months old and I was falling apart, scared to leave the house but scared to stay in it, convinced that something truly awful was going to happen to me either way. I didn't open my post for over a year which caused all sorts of problems, I just shoved it all into a suitcase under my bed, so convinced that every letter would have terrible news in it. When I eventually did go to my gp I had to wait ten months for cbt, which helped enormously, and has helped me since too, it really helped me learn to handle life. Until that kicked in, I was prescribed some anti anxiety meds. I think j tried maybe here different ones before finding the one that was like a light being switched on. It worked. And tbh, ds is now diagnosed with autism, it's still a huge struggle every day, but I've never been back to those terrible depths of despair. I was surprised when my cbt therapist told me I had ocd. I was convinced that that meant obsessively cleaning. What it actually means is unhelpful, obtrusive, obsessive thoughts, which I had by the bucketful. This WILL pass. But you need to be honest with yourself and the people around you. I was a single parent, and had friends around who were aware of what I was struggling with and that really helped. I also had an awesome cbt therapist who knew I had no childcare and scheduled our sessions for when ds was most likely to nap, I'd walk the long way round to the surgery with him in his buggy and more often than not he'd be sound asleep when we got there. You don't have to put up with feeling like this. It isn't a weakness in you, and it's not something you asked for or deserve. It's just crappy thing that happens to some of us sometimes. Please at least try some tablets, if hey don't work then try some different ones. They saved my life."
Skatingonthinice16,Sat 18-Feb-17 22:40:36,"It does but I can't imagine it ever being me. I am so hopelessly stuck. Ds wants to go out tomorrow for the day so I will have to express in the car both ways and I hate that. It's all such hard work. And even whilst we are out it will be hard work. There's no pleasure in it, I just wait for it to be over so I can go home. Then I just wait for the day to be over so I can go to bed. All the time I'm just waiting for it to be over. The diabetes must have been a huge worry for my parents - I worry about passing it on to my dc too. I think that might be the actual end of me. I used to be very careful and really look after myself but now I don't care. If it knocks a few extra years off my lifespan then it's all good."
InfinityPlusOne,Sat 18-Feb-17 22:58:23,"Skating you are suffering from depression and anxiety from what I am reading. You've been advised by many posters now to go and get help. I know you've spoken to your GP already but I can't imagine you've explained the depth of your feelings, if you had I believe you would have already received more help. Lots of us think you would benefit from medication. There have also been repeated posts advising you to stop expressing, or at a minimum stop doing it so frequently. There is no need to keep doing it so often and you are just punishing yourself keeping up that timetable. I think you would see that if you weren't so deeply depressed. You really do need help, is there no one you can talk to amongst your friends and family?"
midsummabreak,Sun 19-Feb-17 10:43:00,"InfinityPlusone Your words echo my thoughts. Having gone through feeling in the depths of despair when my children were young, I too, 'get' how utterly crap it is that your DH refuses to acknowledge his role in supporting both you and your children.Your dH appears to be the typical oldfashioned 1950's style 'absent father' I hope he can 'get on board' more, and if not, that you feel OK to open up to your Mum and Dad that you need support? None of us can get through it alone. Please consider reaching out to others too- be it a support group, trusted Dr/nurse/psychologist/social worker"
Alexandra1988,Thu 23-Feb-17 11:29:33,"I've never contributed to mumsnet before but running out of options for help! I have a 'mild' scoliosis 16degree cobb angle diagnosed at 16, apparently didn't progress so no action taken. I went about my twenties not thinking about it at all, dressing how I liked with no one ever commenting on the appearance of my back. Recently (well the last year) I've been suffering with a variety of rubbish-not sure if I'm depressed, anxious, got medical health anxiety or what. Anyway at present I am utterly obsessed with the appearance of my back. I'm sure it has got more pronounced and like a clever girl I set about taking lots of photos and videos of my back in a variety of positions. Cue utter horror to see what I view as a large hump on my right side. My DH when I pointed this out to him said he had never noticed and there was nothing wrong with me. Informed him I actually had scoliosis so there was- he told me I looked fine. Unfortunately I have spent the last month continuing to video, photograph etc and some days I think it looks ok, some days it looks positively deformed. I suppose the point of my post is to see if anyone else has a) scoliosis or b) similar varying views on how they look. Im not getting a lot of sympathy ('I'm sick of you crying about your bloody back when there's nothing wrong with it') and there's no one who understands that silly as it might seem, it is real to me.

sadandanxious,Wed 22-Feb-17 13:35:43,"I saw the psychiatrist yesterday as everything has been getting too much. I have a diagnosis of depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder and have had that for a while. I self harmed on Sunday for the first time in months and I've been getting lots of suicidal thoughts but I honestly don't think I'd act on them. I've not been sleeping well lately, I can't concentrate or focus on anything and I've been having lots of angry outbursts. I'm seeing a counsellor at the moment and we're working through trauma using EMDR therapy and I'm finding it really tough going. I'm not coping with work and have had so much time off recently and I feel so bad about that. Psych wants to up my quetiapine to 150 mg (from 25 mg) and thinks that'll help wth my moods, anger and sleep. I went up to 50 mg yesterday as it's to go up slowly and I'm so exhausted today. He also said if I feel like harming again to call the crisis team and they can get me in and see if I need to stay in hospital or if I'd be allowed to go home. I feel thats very melodramatic. I've self harmed on and off for years and never once spoken to the crisis team.I feel so rubbish today, very low mood, exhausted and I've barely done any work. I don't know what I want from this.

xoasemarald,Tue 21-Feb-17 15:46:52,"I really don't know what to do :/My DH was diagnosed azoopsermic in October, the news came as a huge blow to him. he is currently on anti-depressants, is supposed to be doing an online CBT course and having counselling sessions. He has had 2 or 3 phone appointments with a counsellor, and has access to services 24hrs a day, where he can ring in and get support.He's been having suicidal thoughts. He's been signed off work with stress and is currently moping about doing not much, despite seemingly being positive about some jobs he has to do around the house to keep him busy.Basically, I fell like I'm getting no support for this - on a few levels 1) acknowledging/accepting that we might not have children, if he doesn't come round to the idea of sperm donor/adoption, which won't happen for along time if his mental health is low. (I'm just turned 34, tick tock...) it's HARD2) No support about how to cope with a depressed spouse that at times is suicidal3) no support for 'me' and how this is affecting me. I feel like crying all the time."
NolongerAnxiousCarer,Tue 21-Feb-17 21:24:43,"Hi,It can be really hard supporting someone with their MH problems. I support DH with serious MH issues and know how hard it is to see someone you love so poorly. I'm also a similar age and feel the pressure of that ticking clock.I'm taking it that your DPs depression stems from his diagnosis and he is participating in treatment, so I think TENSHIs comments are unecessarily harsh. Parents with mental illness can be good parents, just the same as parents with any other illness. ( Both DHs MH team and the children of DHs relative with the same condition assure me of this ) Besides depression is treatable and there is every chance that with time your partner will recover well. Right now your DP is probably grieving for is diagnosis and I suspect you are too.Do you have any support for you? Can you access councelling through work or your GP?The most important thing we can do for ourselves and the people we support is to look after ourselves. If we go under we can't support anyone else. Its really important to make time for you, and to do the things that you enjoy. For me it's going to the gym, but anything that you enjoy. As for supporting him when he is suicidal I have plenty of experience here too unfortunately, and also experience of feeling suicidal many years ago myself. If there is an imediate danger then if possible pursuade him to either phone the crisis team (I'm assuming thats the 24/7 number he has) or to go to A&E with you. If you don't think that you can keep him safe call 999. Another way I have accessed urgent (not immediate) help has been via 111 who sent out an out of hours GP. Samaritans are also available for both of you 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org As for day to day one of the best things you can do is to do and talk about normal stuff. If he can set himself little goals to get him through the day then fab, even if its just having a shower, getting dressed etc. Exercise can really help, as it releases your bodies natural antidepressants. Getting motivation to do it when you are depressed is really tough though. But things like going for a walk can help you to feel better.Feel free to PM me if you want."

Melaniefhappy,Wed 15-Jul-09 21:06:03,"Hi everyone,I totally empathise with all said below. I had a great career, followed by a period as a very happy and busy independent consultant. WE then decided to have children but so far, ONE of us has a satisfying, enjoyable, stimulating career, and the other one battles depression on a daily basis. I know that I am not SAHM material but early on, with two kids very close together, we could not afford simultaneous nursery fees (over £2000 in our area, per month). I could not continue in consultancy due to the hours but a part-time role would not have covered the £2K a month (pre tax). Now my youngest is going to school in Sept and I am delighted (as is she) but I know that if I want to return to work for someone else it will be ME that does it all ....AND work! By this I mean it will be ME doing the packed lunches, book bags, getting kids up, ironing outfits, driving to school, and all other admin as necessary- all before work then it will be (you guessed it) ...ME picking up kids - oh an 18 hour day YIPPIE!!! Just to get some intellectual stimulation and not to be alone 24/7. The loneliness I feel is crippling. Believe me I am trying everything to find a solution. At every step it is my life that comes last. He cannot drive to school due to working 1.5 hours away. When the children were tiny I genuinely felt suicidal and would call him to bring home a bottle of wine (which I would polish off). I still feel incredibly trapped, professionally resentful and deceived. I wish I had the energy to write a book for women trying to decide whether to have children ....confirming that if men they say they'll be involved they WON'T BE as they CAN'T BE!!! Society, and the way jobs work, means that men cannot support us as they wish to, and the extended family has more or less decided to follow golf, art or another lovely activity. It was the latter that I found overwhelming also- the grandparents that I had asked for support PRE birth were not surely those that buggered off and played golf POST birth. Too selfish to help regularly is the reality- ours all live locally (less than five miles) but have golf, art, riding etc!!!!. If they knew how close they had come to not having a daughter in law to cook the sodding Christmas lunch then perhaps they would have helped more, instead of (one set in particular) waiting for their perfect daughter to finally produce offspring (which I know they would find it in their heart to help with). SORRY!!! Too much wine and feeling so trapped. Amazed that mumsnet features suicide/mental health help at the start of this section. Why doesn't society realise just how awful it is to educate women, give them career freedom and then imprison them at home as there is no way to combine two careers by working part-time each and pay the mortgage etc?Thanks for readingTired, lonely, love the kids but wish WE looked after them instead of ME ALL THE TIME."
slowreadingprogress,Sun 26-Jul-09 18:45:04,"Zahora, I really think that you need a revolution in your house. You are clearly either very depressed or utterly unsuited to be a full time mum. Nothing wrong with either of those things! What IS wrong is letting your child be brought up in that atmosphere (""ds is upset and holds me with terror saying 'mummy'"") I honestly think if your DH refuses to step in and take over that you could do something like sell up, downsize, rent - whatever it takes to get you able to leave the house and get him cared for by someone who wants to care for him. I think that's the best thing you could do for him and there is again, nothing wrong in the best person NOT being you. (in future, the best person may well be you, why the hell not? Kids change alot and as parents we all have strengths in different areas and at different times)the other thing that occurs to me is to write down for your GP what you have said about how you are with your ds. I am unqualified to say whether you are depressed or not but to be honest your doctor needs all the facts to make a proper diagnosis. If you can gird your loins to act now, I think the benefits will come to you in the future; happy you, happy ds....and again, it may take some loin-girding but your DH needs to HELP YOU!"
Sasha506,Mon 27-Jul-09 10:42:34,"I absolutely identify will all of the postings here. I wasn't at all sure that I wanted children. I had no experience of them as I was the youngest in the family (at 35!) My husband desperately wanted them, though and his mother and my mother deserately wanted grandchildren so I was made to feel like some sort of pariah for hesitating. I thought ""why not?"" and went ahead, then I found out why not. I had a daughter at 35 and another daughter at 37. They are now 21 and 19. I have photographs of us all as a family when they were 5 and 3 years old and I look as though I am suicidal, and I felt it too. My older daughter only became livable with when she left home and went to university, but she still comes home for extended stays in the holidays and we still clash like we always have. The main problems have been with my younger daughter who was born with mild learning difficulties. The problems have been catastrophic and still are. The only way I have survived this long is to keep working - I hung on to my job with my fingernails, even when most of my salary was going on nursery fees. My advice to anyone thinking about having children late in life is this - unless children mean the world to you, unless you think your life would not be complete without them and unless you can accept the complete loss of life as you knew it - dont do it!! And yes, if I could turn back the clock 22 years I wouldn't have done it, either."
LadyG,Tue 02-Feb-10 21:42:44,Zahora I don't 'buy it ' 100% either but I don't think you have to in order to benefit. I imagine getting to that place of equilibrium where one can really see the joy in everyday is a slow process! However I do feel sometimes it helps me regain a sense of perspective when dealing with the multiple trivial but trying things that children bring to ones life... Speaking as someone who has been pretty depressed recently you do sound depressed. For me it was the realisation that even things that ought to be 'pleasurable' eg spending time with family and friends even getting some time shopping on my own (took a day off work to go Christmas shopping) seemed worthless and a burden. This has made me realise that I am in a depression albeit 'reactive' and this negative person is not the one that I want to be for the rest of my life.When I do manage to 'switch off' my crazy mind it does give me so much relief and I have had 'glimpses' of that pure pleasure you speak of.  Can you try sleep management techniques? (won't give you advice about that as my four and a half year old regularly gets into our bed-I don't even wake up so haven't been able to do much about it-the 18 month old is a darling and never gets up....)How about counselling? Further study either with a view to work or purely for pleasure? A book club? Rediscovering old interests? I used to really love music and hadn't listened to anything new for 5 years or so. Spent the last couple of months discovering and downloading new or 'new to me' bands-online in my kitchen. I relate to your feelings so much and would have felt as you do had I become a stay at home mum-and I am sure so many many others do and hopefully will be along with words of greater wisdom..

Turnip713,Tue 03-Aug-10 08:13:23,"I know this is politically incorrect advice, but if you keep looking at your suitcases and fantasizing about taking off, maybe you should. At least for a little while. What you're doing now isn't working for anyone, why not try something drastic? Things sound pretty drastic right now anyway. See if your husband can take the kid for a month or two or six, and go travel the world. Pack your bags and go to Paris or something. It may get the yearning for your old life out of your system. Maybe it'll give you perspective and you'll realize that you really do want to be a mother. Or maybe you'll realize that you never want to go back and you can reach a new arrangement with your husband. Maybe you could move out and take the kid on weekends and your husband could be the primary caregiver on weekdays? Your marriage (I know this sounds cynical) sounds like it's basically over anyway, so why not divorce and split custody? You can't give your child back, that is wrong, but turning into the worst version of yourself isn't going to do the kid any favors either, and you do sound kind of schizo(your words, not mine). Whichever you choose, time away would give you perspective and time to think, which it sounds like you desperately need. I don't think you're depressed. Depression is when you have a mental illness where even though nothing is wrong, you can't feel happy. It is usually accompanied by fatigue. You don't sound depressed, you sound genuinely unhappy. I'm actually not sure how qualified I am to give this advice since I'm not actually a mother. A big part of the reason I am not a mother is because the only reaction I can realistically imagine myself having to motherhood is exactly the one you've described above, right down to the feeling hollow part. Some people just aren't meant to be domesticated."

Sadglitter,Thu 17-Feb-11 12:43:06,"I have been searching on the web for some women that were brave enough to break the taboo of not talking about how they really feel about having children, when i found this. I have wept my way through the posts, and feel that the way I truly feel inside is the thing that i have to go with. I am nearly 35 and have never wanted kids (i knew this with certainty since i was 9!!)I am now married to an amazing man, who is caring, and loving and gentle, and wants kids.... I have never wanted kids. I think he was hoping that I would change my mind as I got older. We celebrate our 7 year anniversary (get togher)tomorrow and have been married for 2 1/2yrs. I have spent the last 3 trying to convince myself that having a child would be ok. I wouldnt loose my mind, and hate every waking moment of my life - it would work out, except I am filled with a terrible and deep sense of dread & doom about this and have been suffering from depression and feel suicidal a lot now, and really dont want to. After speaking with friend who has just had a kid and regrets it deeply, i have realised that I cant do this, and have a child to please him, and on the weekend of our anniversary I am thinking about breaking up our happy marriage, and am totally distraught and soul destroyed, but know that I am trying to do the right thing for both of us, so he can have the family he has always wanted. My thoughts are with you, and hope it gets easier."
lastminute,Wed 09-Nov-11 10:44:51,"Wow, it's so good to read this thread. I feel for you all who cannot come to terms with their choice to have children. It is such a taboo to even consider not to have them that I fully understand why you decided to go for it. But you can only find out how it is for you when you have them, so don't ever blame yourself, just try to make the most of it for your kids and try to find time for you.My story is a bit different. I have a husband who is 10 years younger than I am and we started talking about having a child when we met and I was 37. I never really had the strong feeling I wanted to become a mother. I have 4 older sisters and many friends who all have children, so during the years I have baby sitted many and seen so much of what it all entitles. So I always doubted if this was good for me. I have always had a good career, travelled the world, partied a lot, love my own time. But with a husband who is 10 years younger I started to think this might be a good thing to do to have a child. He wanted it, but not so strong as to stop smoking for instance, so that made me frustrated, because we had to go through a hospital procedure when it turned out his seed wasn't the best. I stopped smoking, had 5 years of treatments on and off, which made me very unstable due to hormones, miscarriages, operations etc. He just lived his live..At 42 years old the hospital told us to stop treatments, so I felt completely relieved in some way that I tried, wouldn't regret not trying and it didn't work out for us. So we made plans for the future without kids and he was fine with this. Than...I became naturally pregnant at 44! I was panicking, couldn't feel good about this pregnancy, felt too old, not capable of doing this anymore. Everyone told me I look so young and that it would be ok and I would be a good mum. But I didn't feel that way, I became depressed, slept all day, wouldn't see anyone. My husband wanted to keep the baby, but I just couldn't connect with the feeling I was becoming a mum. He said I was negative and should focus on all the good things it would bring to our life. He also said that the first two years would really be my responsibility because he was too busy in his job...at 44 I was afraid I couldn't find the energy anymore, no way! I also thought of being 50 and have a 5 year old, 60 and have a teenager in the house, holidays with one child bored next to us or having to bring somebody else their kid on our holiday to make it nice for the kid... I come from a large family and all I could think of is that this wasn't what I envisioned to be my life and also not for the child. And after months of thinking decided to end the pregnancy...It was sheer horror, hell, something you do not wish your worst enemy to go through. Especially since my husband dropped me of at the hospital and left me alone to go through the procedure and started calling me that he was crying when it was too late..it was so painful. But now the good thing. I feel very relieved that I took this decision and trusted my own feelings. It is difficult now with my husband, but he seems to understand my decision. For him it is so different, he has no friends with babies, hasn't seen what I saw what they go through. That is how many people start with kids, very naive, no idea what they are getting into.There is such a social pressure everywhere that having kids is magical and the best thing there is in life. Think of my parents in law who didn't sleep for weeks because of my doubts..my mum understood me and was a great support. We are planning a holiday now to Asia to have a relaxing time and I'm slowly starting back to work again. I have no regrets fortunately, although I still feel guilt about breaking off a healthy pregnancy. I wish you mothers lot's of support, it really does get better, I see this with all my friends. And start working again, it's so important to have your own life, also for the kids! I also wrote this for all the women who are in doubt, please realize what you want before you become pregnant. I never thought I would become pregnant anymore but I did and to take that decision is heart breaking. I do blame myself for this."

protecttheinnocent,Wed 07-Mar-12 14:36:38,"I can really relate to this thread. I wanted children for a long time, lost a pregnancy in the 2nd tri and didn't get pregnant again for 2 years - I was nearly 40 by the time DS was born. Despite being so wanted, it was still a massive shock. I immediately regretted it and those feelings still haven't waned completely, although going back to work has greatly lessened them.I've felt all of the feelings mentioned on here over the last 2 years but I must say things are a lot better since my job improved - I've been back at work a year and am really into the swing of it again now. I still find DS very hard work though and am hopeless on the one day we have together and can't wait for bedtime - and feel guilty about that - horrendous!One thing I will say is that it has improved incrementally more and more as time has gone on. I suspect that this will only continue as he gets older.I'm also lucky enough to have 2 sets of very helpful grandparents. Without them, things would have been/would be a lot more difficult. We've managed to get away for weekends several times over the last couple of years and that has literally saved my life.What an excellent thread."

bacon,Wed 29-Aug-12 15:12:03,"Feeno - you must have some free time, time to have a hobby, some kind of escape?You must find some escape route because it is strangling and as a mild depressive but havent suffered badly for a while I can understand how it feels. Does anyone know how you feel?If your lucky to have family help then you must use it and find enjoyment in life again. If you have spare money then use a private nursery to have a break.I'm struggling too more than my OH knows, my children seem to have joy in constantly being horrible and wild. Everything I hated about other peoples children have now become mine!!!Feeno - your probably a better parent that youve given yrself credit for. I have done everything to the book, healthy pregnancy, routine, weaning to perfection, home cooked meals, social, etc but its a bit like spending time with a husband you want to divorce because you dislike him yet you are handcuffed to him forever!Seriously, if you are suffering so badly then you should get help to address these feelings have you tried CBT? You sound like you really need it. Many of us on this thread are depressed because of the children not depressed from outside issues and glad you address the effect it could have on your children."
leftfork,Wed 12-Sep-12 11:33:26,"Wonderful ladies,Been following this post for at least 18 months. You've made me feel less confused for which I thank you all. Similar story. DH wanted children, I didn't see the point, I had a great life. 4.5 years later here we are. I was right, I haven't had the light bulb moment and maybe I never will.Feeno,I remember being in a similar situation 2.5 years ago. Eldest child 21 months, 2nd child due, moving town at 37 weeks pregnant and completely depressed at the thought of child number 2. I didn't realise it then but I suffered from depression because I didn't want the kids but only talked to the GP recently - wish I had done it 2 years ago.As other ladies suggest do try and find some time for your self. You have a lot going on but just try and pick one thing. Maybe get Hubbie to take your child all day saturday (are there any Dad's group where you live?) while you do something you really miss doing, even if it's just reading Hello/newspaper the whole day.Anyway, I want to tell you it does get easier. By that I don't mean that you will suddenly love motherhood - I certainly don't but it's little things. My two keep each other company for 20-30 mins at a time now. I even found myself reading a book while with them yesterday ."
ophelia275,Fri 05-Oct-12 17:46:52,"WonderinAloud - I would strongly advise you NOT to have children shortly after moving. I moved a few months after my ds1 was born and I went into a pretty catastrophic depression (I was totally out of it, hallucinating and just feeling absolutely awful). I missed my family terribly and I found the two big changes - having a baby (which is a life change you cannot really ever be prepared for) and moving was just the worst mix. Unfortunately just after ds2 was born our landlord sold the flat we were living in and once again, I got very depressed having to make such a big move after such a big life change. In my experience it is too many big changes in one go and I would not advise it."
HavingAMaybe,Sun 07-Oct-12 01:42:39,"Have been following this thread for some time, and I am so grateful for everyone's honesty.I do not have children. Never thought I would. I am married to someone who never considered that he might not have kids one day. We discussed this at length both before and after getting married (and continue to now) but my feeling is that deep down he thinks I will change my mind.Occasionally I do think that maybe we should - he would be fabulous as a father and he understands most of my reasons for not wanting to.I had a mother who was depressed, unhappy, bitter etc. She has narc tendencies. My father just kept out of it for the most part and had many affairs. Eventually they split but not until I was in my late teens. I have anxiety and depressive episodes. I just know that having a child would be mentally extremely tough for me, despite DH knowing this. I don't think he really understands what it would be like and my fears about this.My friends who have (willingly! more or less) had children have been relatively honest with me as they know how I feel. They have had struggles and depression etc - almost all of them. And for the most part they weren't already dealing with mental health histories.I fear for my marriage ultimately. I love him, but I am not capable of being so selfless as to put myself through it all for him. I almost look forward to getting a bit older and finding that I am no longer able to have kids. Or I sometimes think that it may be a relief to find out that I can't. Which makes me feel like a very bad person obviously as there are people who would dearly love to be able to and can't. Anyway, that's me. Am very grateful for this thread."

canyoubelieveit,Tue 22-Jan-13 23:28:30,"I have a single mother to a one year old daughter who I had at the age of 35. All my life I thought I wanted children and I loved spending time with my friends children. I am so depressed at being a parent and I have absolutely no reason to be as my daughter is the sweetest, most lovable little girl who deserves the very best. I never thought in a million years I would feel like this honestly feel my life is over and I wish so much I could turn the clock back. I have explored anti depressants and therapy and none of it has helped. Has anyone ever thought things would be better for their child if they were adopted? Not that this could ever happen unless you were a teenage Mother. Having a child is a blessing, and it is so unnatural not to feel the greatest love for your child- I know I received it from my parents myself so I just don't understand how I could have got this so very wrong and I didn't know myself. I know it's utterly disgraceful and for most Mothers unbelievable but I really don't know what to do. Does anyone else feel this bad? I feel so guilty and sorry for my daughter but I desperately wish I could return to my old life. I find the practicalities and responsibilities of parenthood daunting and am like a Bridget Jones messy untidy childlike and it feels really tough rather than feeling you do whatever you can for your child I am not enjoying all the different stages which other parents understandably love. I have lost my confidence at work as I work 3 days a week so am out of the loop and I can't enjoy the days I have with my daughter- can't get things done, can't manage to look in anyway acceptably normal and groomed and be organised, tidy and practical. I'm also not at all interested in peppa pig etc. I honestly feel I am not cut out to look after another human being and it will get more demanding practically and financially as the years go on. I look around at all the Mothers I know and many of them have more children and a much more demanding life but they are motivated by the passion they feel towards their children. I really don't know what I can do to turn my thinking around and I've got to do it for the sake of my daughter. Does anyone have any advice? I just wish there was a way out of parenthood- can you believe it?"

BabooshkaBabooshka,Thu 13-Jun-13 08:50:21,"Shakey1500, my kids are young (5 and 2) and I have a little bit of support from my husband and mother (most of the grandparents live abroad). However, the support is mostly physical but they are also the ones who made me have another child, knowing how mentally ill I was so I don't really feel very supported by them. In all honesty, I don't think they really have a clue how I feel, even though I have spoken about it so much. I am just so so angry with myself, I can't get over it. I go over and over it in my mind and am just so constantly angry and the worst part is that I feel like these relatives don't really care about me that much because at the end of the day they put their desires (for another child/grandchild) before me and my wellbeing. It was obviously more important for my husband to have this child than for me to be well and happy. I have been sacrificed for his wants. It's not even like he is such a great dad and I wonder why we did all this when most of the time he seems so bored and frustrated with them. Recently the constant noise (high pitched screaming at 6am and constant fighting) has started to really get to me and I am starting to get very irritated by it and have started wearing earplugs all the time (which are not very comfortable).I just don't know what to do. I don't want to take pills as I am not ""depressed"" - i am just stuck in a situation i hate and regret. Sorry I sound like an absolute cow, I am not, my kids don't go without, but i am just dying inside."

Medication didn't help so trying to control thro diet but after 12+ years of oppositional behaviour ALL the time, EVERY conversation, feel so so weary and hopeless.

I guess it's easier than accepting that I regret giving in and having a child, that its made me very unhappy, that its destroyed a relationship that meant everything to me but that I'm just trying to get on with it. I recently posted elsewhere about feeling dp and i needed time away from dd and that we had only had 4 days away from dd this year. Lots of people posted that 4 days was a lot and that they hadn't left their child for years. That thread made me feel like an outcast. This one doesn't. Thanks for that. Ps hope Zahora and others are ok."
fullfathomfive,Sun 17-Nov-13 12:13:34,"To all the brave and brilliant women on this thread who have wrestled with a similar dilemma: I'd appreciate it a lot if you could read to the end. I don't know what I'm doing and I'm in a state of complete despair.I am seven weeks pg, but very ambivalent towards the pg. I know that to have a baby, you should really want one. And I'm not sure how much I do. I am forty and have no other children, so at this point I think I have to accept that I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't. It's going to be difficult either way; with either course of action, there will be hardships and loss and regrets. But this still doesn't help me to know what to do.My situation is complicated by the fact that I am 40; dp is almost 60. But hey! at least I have a dp, right? Lots of people go it alone at this age.... the other factor that doesn't help is that there are no aunts / cousins / grandparents / brothers / sisters, etc in our town, so we'd be dealing with all childcare on our own. My family are miles away. His family are grown / scattered / dead, etc.I love playing with babies and small children, and I have a nephew who I adore. But I've never spent more than 48 hours in sole charge of a tot. THe idea of it fills me equally with feelings of excitement and horror. Now that I am pg, I constantly try to imagine myself doing the things I normally do, only while being in sole charge of a two-year-old. This rules out: taking a long bath; going running; lying here on Sunday morning typing this; browsing shops; taking a long time to cook something new; staying late at work because I feel like getting a bit extra done; basically, the extent to which it changes your life makes my head spin. It is intimidating me. How do you all manage?!I keep thinking to myself: you are 40. You've managed this far, without children. You haven't particularly craved them. You are doing okay now (after many and various difficulties, especially in my 20s). But then I think: if you terminate, you will regret it because this is your last chance.Although my desire to have kids has always been ""Oh, it'll be nice if it happens"", rather than ""Got To Do It At All Costs!!"". Now it is happening and if I'm completely honest, I can't say I'm over the moon. My initial reaction when I saw the faint line was, ""Oh. S**t.""  I thought, ""perhaps I'll miscarry, then the decision will take care of itself"", but I don't think this is going to happen, somehow. I'm an idiot and I don't know what to do. I have printed this entire thread and read it lots of times. The bits that resonate are MelaniefhappyAND work! By this I mean it will be ME doing the packed lunches, book bags, getting kids up, ironing outfits, driving to school, and all other admin as necessary- all before work then it will be (you guessed it) ...ME picking up kids - oh an 18 hour day YIPPIE!!!wantmyflattummybackI do love DS and absolutely want the best for him - it hurts when he is upset. BUT - I still feel it would have been better for all concerned if he had never existed.Of course, it's highly unfortunate to look back, with hindsight, and think ""if I could live again, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have children"". And I would like to avoid this, of course. But then you have mothers saying ""it was the making of me"", ""the most intense love affair ever"", ""the best thing I ever did"". But I have no clue which way it will go for me. All I know is that I am full of trepidation. I am browsing the thread reminding myself of posts that resonate, but there are just too many, and it's so upsetting that I'm now crying.fortyandstillunsure, canyoubelieveit and lastminute all speak very loudly to me.But I just don't know if I can terminate. When I look at new mums with their babies, I feel jealous! But I don't feel at all jealous of older mums in their fifties struggling with hormonal teenagers, and knackered sixty-year-olds working difficult jobs to put demanding kids through university. And the baby bit is oh-so-transient. Perhaps I should focus on being a brilliant auntie to my three neices and nephews, and a good partner and loving daughter to my brilliant mum (who I haven't always had the best relationship with, but I do now).I'm scared of the commitment, and scared of living out the rest of my years feeling as though I've missed something wonderful and as though I lack a sense of purpose. Plus, I would always be looking over my shoulder at that time when I was 40, thinking ""what if...?"". To be honest, though, I don't think an abortion would ruin my life. I had one at 35 and didn't regret it or think about it much. In the back of my mind I was thinking ""there can be another time"". But this time, there can't. I need to take control, make a decision, and enjoy the rest of my life. Yet this is easier said than done. In some ways, getting pg at 40 is like a gift. I have had not a jot of sickness. So why am I so unsure what to do for the best.Then there is the small matter of money: neither me nor dp have much money. He is retired and has a pension of £1,000 a month. I'd be on maternity. Not much to sustain three of us! I should have known my own mind before getting pg. There is a counselling service for women in our position called 'ticktockcounselling' but I didn't know until I was pg. I agree with all of you who cite social pressures: threads like this are like 24 carot gold. Elsewhere, all you hear about are the supposed delights and joys.What a mess. "
Zahora,Mon 29-Jun-09 02:39:04,"Does anyone else regret having your child? I loved my old life. My husband really wanted a child and I put it off for so long, just knowing that it's not my calling. I gave in after so many rows thinking I would adjust. It was either that or leave my husband whom I loved very much. My son is 2 years old and it has been such a lonely and desperate struggle. I feel like my wonderful life has turned upside down. I still do not feel like a mother. I look after my son full time, I even breastfed for a year, yet it just feels so ...hollow. It's not me. I miss my old life so much I just feel like walking out and leaving my husband and son. I hate playing in the park. I want to go to a gallery. I hate watching peppa pig- I want to read a novel. I hate going to playgroups - I want to have lunch with freinds. I do everything I can for my son and he is lovely. Yet motherhood so far has left me feeling like I have been conned out of my real life. Will life ever return to normal. Will my son feel that I am detached? I don't think I'm depressed. Has anyone else felt like this?"
DavetheCat2001,Mon 03-Feb-14 19:09:30,"I sometimes find myself wishing the time away as I find looking after small children so desperately boring.I have a DS who is 3 and a DD who is 6 months, and whilst I love them dearly, the 3 year old knows exactly how to push my buttons and I spend an awful lot of time telling him off and occasionally shouting at him, which always makes me feel sad and depressed.Some days I am so tired I just want to slump on the sofa, but you can't with a 3 year old who is bouncing off the walls and a baby who requires regular feeding (I'm BF'ing).I drag myself to the park and stand around freezing, windy playgrounds and wonder if this is all there is to life. What I'd really love to do is drop them off with a grandparent for a weekend and go off with OH and have some fun..I can't remember the last time we did anything or went anywhere that didn't involve kids. Unfortunately my parents are in their mid 70's and in poor health so can't help, and OH's parents live over 3 hours away, so we have no family support. I am so envious of friends who have younger, fitter and closer parents to take their kids off to the park or away for weekends.None of my close friends have ids ether..it seems to have skipped my generation of friends a bit (I'm 40), so I perceive them as all still having loads of freedom and going out having fun etc, and I can't..selfish I know.Anyway..thanks for this thread. It's very comforting to know that being an 'earth mother' isn't for everyone!I wonder too how Baboushka and the original OP are doing now...?"
Madcat22,Fri 14-Feb-14 13:59:56,"I've got a six week old baby girl who I love terribly. However, having had PND after the birth of my DS three years ago, I am now starting to develop similar symptoms which is terrifying because it was awful last time. I was on Citalopram last time which helped but it was when my son was older than my little one so it wasn't a problem to give up BF. BF is going really well this time and I really don't want to stop but absolutely won't take any AD and BF at the same time. Feeling very lonely and isolated with no one to talk to so thought I'd post my very first ever message on MN to see if anyone had any other tips about coping with PND without AD. I'm starting CBT in 10 days time but really want someone to talk to or some informal help too so I don't feel so alone. Please help!! My babies deserve more than a depressed mummy."
Bollydarling,Wed 14-May-14 00:36:37,"Thanks. I can really relate to a lot of what been said and realise that I am not depressed, just not happy with my current situation.It really is taboo to say anything negative about having children. If I am slightly down with one 'friend' who has spent the deposit for a house on IVF, I am immediately reminded of how lucky I am. Yet I have to keep stum when she says how much she needs her week long yoga retreat in Turkey. I have had a friend reshuffle since having kids. I think for those of you considering kids I would sayIf you are getting on a bit (I was 40 when DS was born and 42 when DD was born) and in any way ambivalent then don't do it. Try and ignore the pressure or deal with it outright, take the steps to ensure you don't stay in a relationship when DP/DH changes his mind about kids, find something else meaningful to fill your time etc. I'm not sure that I regret that I had kids but if I had my time again things would be different. If you do go ahead make sure you have done your maths. Full time child care for one child can be covered by a £20k salary with a bit to spare. It costs over £2k a month for two.... And when you have moved to the sticks for a better quality of life, £35k jobs in the charitable sector are hard to come by. I didn't plan to have kids so didn't plan my career. DH earns enough for us to live on but there's nothing to spare. Two kids also seem to be sooooo much more difficult than one so if you are in any way ambivalent about the second don't do it. Having said that my 9 month old DD is gorgeous with a sunny nature (she didn't get that from me) and seems to be an easier baby than her brother. But I am sure when he is 4 and she is 2 he will be the easier child.Don't have preconceptions about how you will parent or let anyone tell you what to do. Have confidence in your gut instincts. Breast feeding past 6 months, baby wearing, bed sharing etc have helped me bond with children whom I think I love but have no overwhelming feelings for. For other people bottles, schedules and sleep training work as they enable them to return to work and have a break. It is very difficult when grandparents are too old/far away to be actively involved, and the local mums I have bonded with are those that work or who will be going back to work shortly so limited opportunities for helping out with child care to give each other a break. It feels selfish to walk out the door for run as DH walks after a 12 hour day but if it means I have more patience then it isn't selfish. I personally have used baby and toddler groups as a chance for break as sometimes someone will hold the baby and the toddler can play independently, it just depends on how he is feeling. Often someone will make me a cup of coffee as wellGood luck to us all. This thread has made me realise, once again, that things are not so bad for me"
HoneyBadger80,Wed 28-May-14 20:27:56,"Its funny how you never love your children so much as when they are sleeping! I mean I love my DS, don't get me wrong, I have always loved him in a dutiful functional kind of way, but I have never enjoyed being a parent until recently, and even now occasionally its really tiresome... Known affectionately to me (or not) as 'being under house arrest', it was horrid being a SAHM- just mind numbingly boring and endlessly tiring, like an 18hr job with no pay and no one to talk to, then in the other 6 hours you get to do further housework etc and maybe squeeze a bit of a snooze in here and there.When you're a single mom, you might as well be in solitary confinement, but its even worse because you add total sleep deprivation, slave labor and mental torture that you cant share with a significant other...it comes to something when you have seen all the episodes of peppa pig (my favorite being the one where they go ice skating) and the thing you look forward to is an episode you haven't seen, and that you have managed to learn basic sign language courtesy of Mr Tumble.I was never maternal, people even used to comment how odd it looked if i held a friends baby (normally at arms length hoping it wouldn't puke), i have no idea why I decided to have a baby- it seemed like the right time I suppose, financially stable, engaged (although he left not long after DS was born) blah blah blah. Turns out I'm a crap mom, not in the basic needs sense, but in the actually liking children sense. I mean if it were Neanderthal times then I'd be the most awesome mom ever- like if it were about survival of the fittest then my offspring would be chubby feral survivors.... but its not. Its a day and age where even the mere sniff of not being totally grateful and in love with motherhood gets you shot down by the mummy mafia. Those who chirp on about how fulfilling and meaningful having children is and who do arts and crafts 8 hours a day, and bake cakes with perfect princess daughters like something off a bloody flora advert.I had post natal depression, which sucked, I dont think i really loved DS with affection until he was about 6 months old thanks to that, but i was a good mom in the functional sense (keeping things clean, keeping DS fed and watered, changed and comfortable and happily dribbling at the tweenies) for the first 18 months, it didn't get really bad until the 'terrible 2,3 and 4's kicked in, along with speech, potty training, breaking things, tantrums and the words 'no' and 'why'. In hindsight i think i got off pretty easy as my DS was a pretty good child looking back and having experience now of other peoples kids who are far more 'naughty' than my DS was, or friends with kids who have disabilities requiring constant care... but at the time, being an exhausted single mom with no support network and no outside contact from grown ups other than my parents or family maybe once or twice a week, i used to think about walking out all the time and leaving DS with his dad or with my parents....I mean men just take off all the time without much recrimination, so why couldn't I?NO IDEA...god i wanted to....I wanted to SO badly. I used to fantasize about running away and working in bars in greece or on cruise ships etc all the time, but there was just something that stopped me, I don't know if it was some deeper primal in-build mother love/instinct or just plain society based expectation and guilt. I used to get to the point of packing my bags then I'd have a flash forward into how much I could screw him up emotionally. See his little face understanding that his mom didn't love him. To think I hadn't loved him enough to stay, to think he wasn't worth the effort, to think he could live his life feeling like he wasn't worthy and where those feeling of self loathing/guilt/worthlessness might take him. The kind of life he could end up living if I weren't there to keep fighting for better for him(cue tears and floods of guilt). Bloody awful times they were. It was just a cycle of misery- frustration- resentment and guilt.It started getting easier when he turned about 5 and started to understand the world a bit better, and being more independent....I think it also helped that I started working full time about the same time. He's 8 now, and I can say now that he's brilliant 90% of the time- he's my little mate and has a great personality and I love him to bits, I miss him now a little bit when he goes to his dads or grandparents, which is a relatively new experience as I've always enjoyed and craved my child-free time and as long as his safety was assured I'd go and have a 'single and childfree' 48 hours once every 2 weeks- where I could pretend I had my life as it was pre-DS and go back to real life on a sunday evening.Having been just me and him for so long now, I cant imagine my life without him (wait that's not true- I imagine my life without him fondly and wistfully for 5 seconds, then realize there's only so much clubbing in Day-Glo bikinis a woman can do at the age of 34 LOL). Its a pain in the bum all the rushing about and organizing and planning that you do when you are trying to 'enrich' your child's life, all the driving to cubs/football/cricket/parties/swimming lessons/karate/play dates...god it just goes on and on and never ends, kind of like the laundry pile created by afore mentioned extra curricular activities. I am convinced I could personally captain an elite squad of Navy seals with my military timing and planning precision.When i look back i feel massively ashamed and guilty about all the times i resented him and the life i chose in having him, yes it was hard, yes it was tiring and thankless and exhausting and at times soul destroying. Yes I felt like I had lost who I was, and that the only thing that defined me was being a mom, that I had given up my life for 18 years. But truth be told I was selfish and immature and not particularly nice before I had him- I realize that now. He has taught me to be truly selfless, to make sacrifices when I REALLY don't want to, to think always of someone else's future beyond my own and having him has in general made me a more patient, organized and independent person than I would ever have thought possible. I still wear my 'bad mom' t-shirt every now and again (metaphoric of course) and scream and shout at him over small things that needn't be screamed about...and he knows to give me a wide berth on those days... but when I see the kind, sensitive, helpful, mostly polite and thoughtful boy that he is becoming already, I have hope that despite everything, despite all the negative thoughts and misery and despair i felt in the early years, and all the crying in the shower, and all the wishing I'd never had him, that he is, against the odds, going to turn out to be a lovely young man....and it absolves me a little of the guilt. That if our children are reflections of us as parents, I cant be such a truly awful terrible incapable mother. TBF I think I got away really lightly with him- cos he's more of a moaner than a rebel, and aside from ongoing (grrr) annoying nightly negotiations about why he has to go to bed at 8.30, he's pretty low maintenance.I never thought i'd find myself saying i wouldn't change having him...up until the last couple of years i was still saying i regretted ever having kids...in fact i could have been voted the person most likely to build a time machine and go back and change everything so I could carry on clubbing in furry boots and run away with the circus... but now the hardest times have passed, I wouldn't change him. ....still there's the 10% of the time when I cant wait for him to grow up and sod off lol.Hugs to everyone feeling crappy...all I can say is hopefully it will get easier for you like it has for me. And don't feel guilty if you aren't mary poppins- the mummy mafia will manage with one less member. xxxxxx"

diannside,Wed 01-Oct-14 09:03:10," my mother regretted me and left me homeless at age 13. I knew it didn't matter how well I acted and that it wasn't my fault that she was so abusive, but it still hurt. I discovered music festivals as a result. I soon began selling my artwork at them, touring all over the country. the farther away from my abusive mother I was, the better I felt. from 15 to 28 years old, it was always the same life-long art goals- to finish new masterpieces and then sell them at the shows. I gained recognition around the country while still a teenager and thought I was on my way... but then I was approached by a guy that seemed to care a lot about me. I was very busy and wasn't even lookn for a boyfriend but I fell for his charms. I was dumb because he turned out to be an abuser. I told him that I didn't want children but he kept pushing me to have unprotected sex. he beat me while I was pregnant. to make along story short, my art dreams have been replaced with single motherhood, and i'm dying inside. no time for the kind of art I do. I used to lock myself in a room for weeks literally. I do love my son and I try to block out the pain of being severed from my livelihood but it always resurfaces again and again. I've always used my art to heal and I'm unable to get my therapy. I feel like instead of being that well known and respected artist, instead i'm on my way to becoming my worst nightmare- my mother. worst part is that I've ended up moving to my mother's home town for more support. unfortunately her alcoholism makes her distant and it's just me and my son on our own now in iowa. iowa a place I never would have saw myself 5 years ago from Colorado where I used to live. I am afraid for my son because if he grows up seeing me so miserable, well that's not good for him either. sad to say that I actually felt freer in jail. i'm sorry but it's true. I try to deny these feelings and I just feel like I don't have a soul anymore and even have suicidal thoughts. so far my son is a happy and vibrant 2 year old but i'm worried that my deep sorrow could destroy both of our lives. I feel like i'm being swallowed and can never breath. can't be good. god please help. i'm not ok"

Sirraleigh,Fri 05-Dec-14 20:45:15,"Hi everyone & AmonRa1,I read your post and like blackeyedsally said, I think you should not have children.Having kids is as terrible as you describe it. I am a caring father of a four year old son and I regret having him every day. There's really hardly anything I enjoy about being a parent. You will be sleep-deprived all the time, you will end up a zombie most of the time just dragging yourself from one mind numbing activity to the next. With an annoying whining kid that will demand attention. You will be wishing to be doing other things all the time, but your ""me-time"" will be reduced to almost nothing.And all that is not even the worst bit. The worst thing is being stuck! I mean, you cant leave your partner and kid, because you know they'll suffer even more... So, the only option you'll have is to accept that you'll be miserable for years to come... Someone once wrote: ""most men lead lives of quiet desperation""... I know now that that is what being a parent is truly about.And i think i'm kind of lucky. My wife is hot and we have great sex, i have a wonderful job, great friends and grandparents that help out, but the moment i get home and need to be a parent... I turn into a depressed zombie...I wish i'd known what being a parent was really like 4 years ago. I would have never ever ever EVER have had a child.Ramble over...Take care everyone."
Shakey1500,Mon 02-Feb-15 19:58:25,"Bingesplodge and TheLondonerHello lovelies. I'm the poster who had the thunderbolt moment when DS was aged 4. I'll reiterate, I've never felt such relief over anything in my life and literally sank to my knees and wailed like a banshee.What's good is that you both have support from close family members/partner that are able to least share the load. I recall DH being away from home for 2 weeks and I was struggling massively, totally overwhelmed. Clock watching until bedtime till I could at least breathe on my own (and smoke copiously). My parents came one afternoon and whilst I thought I was plastering the right kind of smile on my face they must have seen right through me and offered to take DS overnight. The relief!DS is 8 this year and in all honesty, I know it seems like a distant lifetime away but time really has flown. I do still have pangs of yearning for my ""old"" life but it seems so far back that this life has morphed into me accepting that this is my life (if that makes sense) and I'll admit I sometimes often fantasise about retirement when I'll be totally able to do exactly as I please.TheLondoner You are right, it will come. And do you know why I think it will? Because I truly believe that if none of us really cared, we wouldn't bother to find threads like these to seek help, words of comfort, knowledge we're not alone. It's bloody hard, especially in the early years. I just had no option but to muddle through the fug, take each day/week/month at a time and wait for it to pass. There was no lead up to the thunderbolt, it just happened. Perhaps because I (thought I'd) reconciled myself to the fact I would always feel as despairing as I did. I wasn't trying, wasn't looking for it, I just ploughed through. But I'm mighty grateful it did and a huge burden has lifted. Keep ploughing, keep doing the best you can, even if you feel it's not enough, it is enough for now. We're none of us perfect, there are no guidelines, our emotions can overtake us sometimes, we will get there in our own time, in our own way. Because we're human. And it's totally ok to feel absolutely rotten about it and yearn backwards. As I often say, it's not wrong it's just...different. And for those that slate this thread and have no understanding, I don't feel anger towards them, I feel glad that they have not felt like I and many of us did. Because I wouldn't wish it on any parent. Glad you found this thread. I always have it on watch and always try to reply  Even if you don't feel like it, you're doing great."

borrowedflat,Mon 17-Aug-15 20:42:52," thisis I've just been re-reading this thread because it comforts me and wanted to reach out to your post. Please remember this thread is written by parents who are struggling, and that is not necessarily the only thing they (we) think and feel. I was very depressed when pregnant and got excellent counselling through the hospital, which also lasted 2 years after my dc was born. If you haven't already, please talk to your midwife about getting some support."
lifeinruins,Sat 05-Sep-15 03:52:27,"I need to put this ""out there"". Unlike many people on this thread, I am not technically a SAHM. I am currently studying at university, doing an honours level degree part time. This is for a career change. It's tough and I must have top marks in order to proceed further.I used to have a career in IT. I had a 6-figure salary. I knew for many years that it wasn't for me, that I didn't enjoy it, and so I started studying part time - slowly preparing to step out. I had a small but beautiful Victorian-era house. I could afford my own mortgage, my own lifestyle. I do have a history of anxiety and depression though, but I learned to manage it.I married my best friend, whom I love dearly. I always thought that I had to have a child - my biological clock was saying so, my family was saying so - it was just ""one of those things"", even though I am not maternal and don't like children - but I was convinced (primarily by my mother) that it wouldn't matter because it is different with one's own child.I got pregnant on the night we got engaged. My husband wanted the child - me: well, the timing was horrid (I just changed, jobs, was in 3rd year of my degree, we were planning a wedding and honeymoon and to just enjoy being a couple)... but I wasn't going to have an abortion. So - we had a beautiful baby girl. Because there was no way I could have enough time and energy to hold a fulltime job and study successfully enough to be able to achieve the level I needed, it was decided that I would leave my job and IT and concentrate on the studies and motherhood. My husband makes a very good salary, and we could afford it. What we could not afford was a larger place, so we all moved into my small house. It became very crowded, the decor haphazard, but it had to happen (partly of me - I refused to move out of my home when I found out I was pregnant. I am very home bound, and, by then, with my biological instinct having calmed down, I already realised what a horrible mistake I made. That I didn't want a child at all. That I treasured my life as it was. But it was too late.)My daughter is 18 months now. She goes to a good child care place 4 days a week. She gets sick with minor colds a lot, which she has to stay home for quite often, but we have support from both grandmothers. I get to study - something I enjoy a lot.And, still, I am MISERABLE! I love my daughter, I am a very good mother. I don't lose it with her, I am practicing respectful parenting, I keep my depression at bay most of the time, when I am around her.... and I HATE MY LIFE.I pop 10 pills a day to keep the depression at bay. I've seen a psychologist but there's nothing really that can be done because I am not being delusional - my life has changed in exact ways I see, with some good things (you know, those moments of connection with the child, watching her grow, etc etc), but many of the changes I hate and, overall, the good does not in any way, shape or form make up for the bad. I can't lie to myself, I can't forget about it, I can't ignore it. I used to be a beautiful energetic person, who took a lot of pride in her appearance, was VERY fit, and was sexual. I am too tired now - I don't have energy/time/or am sick with the latest virus my daughter brought into the house, which saps energy even more. I have not enjoyed sex since the day my daughter was born. I participate in it for my husband's sake. I live in jeans and jumpers - those that I don't care whether they get stained or not. I don't even remember what is in my closets, let alone remember how to dress up (and, oh boy, did I used to - I used to favour gothic clothing and make up).My house I already mentioned - there are things constantly in need of fixing, cleaning, it's got plastic boxes and computer things everywhere, because we have no where to put them - and no energy to really sort things out and throw things out. My beautiful house is no longer a place of pride and joy for me - it's still my home though.Because I have left my career, and because of where I was in my career at the time I left (transitioning from a programmer to a project manager, but not having yet enough time in the manager's role to be able to get job as one, and, now being out too long from a position of a programmer - 5 years away from cutting-edge stuff is a VERY LONG TIME in this industry), I don't think I could possibly get a job which will allow me to support myself... and this is something I always was able to do. I am holding onto my studies, but I am so, so exhausted. I am not sure I can keep that up and it's still 4 years before I can actually start working in the new field.My husband is exhausted too - he always understood me, understood my mental health issues, was always supportive, but he is feeling hopeless. There's nothing he can do (any more than he already can, given that he has to hold down the job to pay for us all). We've all been living with the idea that ""it's going to get better"" - but, 18 months later - it isn't. Every time I have to spend more than 1 hour on my own with my daughter I end up looking at the clock every 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes counting down to when someone else can take over. I always have to push the thought away of ""I'd rather be elsewhere, do something else"". Lately, that something else has been ""sleep"". I just want to sleep. It's depression and I am tired of fighting it, and I have assignments due, so I can't just sleep the days away.We've started talking about my husband and daughter moving out to his mother's. He doesn't want to. His mother, of course, wouldn't want him to. I don't want him to. But I don't want to be paying this price. I don't want to be a shadow of myself. I want my life back, so much (even though I know I can't have it back - because I want a life with my husband, whom I love... but without my daughter!!!!) I love her too, very much... but I love myself more! And it's selfish and horrid, but I do!I do."

Viewofhedges,Mon 22-Feb-16 16:24:42,Hello Cornwall. There haven't been many posters on here for a while but I've seen your messages and wanted to reach out with a hug. We're in very different positions - I was due to start IVF in January but after crying snottily down the phone at the nurse we panicked and pulled out. I'm now back on the thinking about it and feeling every day slip past (I'm 39 now) and not knowing if we're having a lucky escape or missing out on something amazing. I don't know if I'll ever know.For what it's worth I think you're in a very difficult situation and I'm not surprised you're struggling. I can't begin to imagine how hard twins must be and how hard it must be to have a partner who doesn't want kids. (My DH and I are similarly torn which means it's hard to decide but at least we're as hopeless as each other). It's a real shame that your DH can't step up and interact with his own family. Great that you can afford a Nanny though and I hope you can use that resource to give yourself some time to rest and breathe. I hope you can find some support in IRL. Are there any twins support networks you can join? My friend had twins and a toddler and I'm surprised she didn't collapse (I went to help her a few times but when she told me to 'just get a dog' when we couldn't have kids and were trying to figure that out in our minds we stopped talking. But now both DH and I really want a dog!) I really do send you as much support as possible over the internet and hope that as they grow you will experience some of the joy that's supposed to come with kids.
Simmi1,Tue 23-Feb-16 23:26:56," I remember wanting to run away when dd1 was a baby as I was tired and overwhelmed. However things did get easier when she started sleeping through at 6 months and then I went back to work at 9 months. Then I got pregnant again, and was happy to be expecting. Had dd2 6 months ago and have been experiencing severe IBS symptoms ever since which has really made me regret having her. I now have 2 small children and I feel unwell. Never had any of theses problems before birth and no one seems to know what's causing it and how to fix it. I feel miserable and depressed and want my old life back when dd1 was in nursery and I was working and most importantly was healthy. This has made me feel suicidal."
lazyminimoo,Sat 23-Apr-16 02:41:52, Yes i have really regretted having my son as i have depression social anxiety an i feel like he shouldn't have to have me for a mum an i feel like i would be less depressed if i didn't have to worry about how I'm affecting him and how hes gong to grow up feeling regretful and sad that he has a mum like me . Its just guilt that i wouldn't have to have if i didn't have a child. I don't want him gone but i at times feel it would have been best all round if i hadn't had him or if only id have had him adopted so his life would turn out better and i wouldn't feel so bad and worry all the time about how I'm not being a good mum an he deserves much better . I have mostly thought yes in a heartbeat i would go back In time an have the abortion I was planning to have but didn't because the dad begged me not to an i didn't wanna lose him as he would have dumped me if i had aborted . I sometimes think maybe i was selfish not aborting him as he now has a life that i feel is worse then most 3 year olds lives because they have nice normal mum's not socially anxious depressive mums .
diamond457,Mon 25-Jul-16 18:51:46,"I constantly grieve over my old life and all the potential I had and the things I could have done with my life. I had dd at 19 so its my own fault. But I am depressed and my career is well and truly down the pan. Applying for jobs I wouldn't have took in a million years because its all I can do now due to childcare restrictions etc.I do feel like a caged animal, a shell of who I was.but I do love dd and im a good mum and she deserves the best.I have to live with the grief the rest of my life."
dranaksjd,Thu 25-Aug-16 11:19:56, I regret having my son. If I could I back I would. I'm not depressed. I'm just not cut out to be surrounded by a child for years of my life and all the limitations that entails.

Sirraleigh,Tue 21-Feb-17 16:19:03,"I was happy. What I wasn't happy with, I changed. There's a lot you can change in life. Being a parent, when it makes you depressed and hate yourself, is not easy to change.Any advice is appreciated. How did you deal with, cope with that regret???"
AnxiousCarer,Tue 21-Feb-17 17:43:09," Hi, it sounds like things are tough at the moment. I know how stressful I find it when DH has been out of work and We've been in the same sort of financial situation as you. As everything is feeling hard I wonder if a trip to the GP is in order. You could be depressed as a culmination of all the stress. Do you do anything judt for you? I find that really important for my MH. I find exercise and meditation and mindfulness helpful. I always seem to have a better day when I meditate before work for 10 mins. I used an app called headspace initially which was useful. I tend to do it on the bus on the way to work."
rightsofwomen,Mon 24-Oct-16 10:55:28," I just don't like being on them. I don't know if I ever really was clinically depressed, but started taking them as I didn't want to look like I was refusing the help the GP was offering me."
FuckingHellz,Thu 15-Dec-16 21:52:06,"Please take this advice - reduce your dose by 2.5mg every month. You won't get any withdrawal effects, brain zaps or feel you are getting depressed again. It can take a few months but I've done it twice now successfully A long time ago a go told me to alternate doses ie 10 mg one day then 20mg the next. I was fucked and went back on the original dose as I thought I was getting depressed again.You can do it, just be sure in your mind that you're ready to come off them x"
BingBongBam,Thu 15-Dec-16 22:24:56,"Yes, be sure you are ready to come off them, I thought I was and five weeks later I'm depressed again having been feeling great until the last couple of days, though maybe that's down to work stress and friendship changes."
WindfallenArch,Tue 04-Oct-16 13:36:50," Everything really is as bad as I think it is - I don't think it's catastrophic thinking - I really am unemployable, friendless and skint. I see no end to it. I'm simultaneously skilless and overqualified so have no idea what to do to get some work to at least have a reason to get out of bed and wash. My family are all dead, my children have recently reached the stage where I embarrass them - they were my world and gave me a reason to live. My marriage is an empty shell. I have nothing and no one. I therefore wonder if there is anything wrong with my mental health at all - I may just be perfectly reasonably hopeless."
OhNoNotMyBaby,Tue 04-Oct-16 13:43:43, Please go and see your doctor. I'm no expert but you seem very depressed to me. You are a wife and a mother and an individual with unique skills and talents. You are not worthless - you've just forgotten and misplaced your confidence and self-esteem. Get some medical help and then you can start working your way back to becoming the real you again.
Allatseainthemidlands,Tue 04-Oct-16 13:50:53,"I know nothing about mental health but if you need a reason to get out of bed and wash/ make yourself employable have you considered volunteering? You can do all sorts of amazing stuff as a volunteer and meet new people/make new friends in the process. Does your OH feel the same way about your marriage? Could it be retrieved? Is it worth talking about or seeking counselling? And as for your children- this is just a stage- they will get past it - maybe not for several years but they will. They will need you to help them negotiate the early adult years- uni, parenthood etc. It's easy to make your world all about them but you had a world before they came along and you are a whole person whether or not they think so. Please don't despair- and do consider seeing your GP about your sense of sadness and loss. Good luck"
WindfallenArch,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:25:30," natsku I don't rule it out, but I guess the reason I am posting here is that I really do think that there is nothing wrong with my brain chemistry. So much awful stuff has happened and having spent months unemployed and being rejected over and over again and seeing no end in sight, I am, it would seem justifiably hopeless rather than clinically depressed. I have nothing and I've lost hope. That's not an illness - it's a reaction. "
useryourillusion,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:27:49,"I'm so, so sorry you are going through this. Your despair screams from every line and I really do feel for you and the agony you are going through.I can totally relate to your situation and can truthfully say there is hope for you. It seems as if you are an intelligent, self-aware person - while this very attributes can give you painful insights, they are also potential springboards to happiness, fulfilness and achievement.The raw materials are there, is is just a process to use them positively.Posting here and expressing yourself is a real breakthrough.Well can I hear the sadness, the paralysing feelings you are having, but please, please try to start with a little self-care... maybe something as small as washing your face? I can't fully explain why but once you put even a little time into yourself, this positivity grows and helps you to help yourself.Sorry if this is rambling, but please keep going, you are made of stars xx"
Dontyouopenthattrapdoor,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:34:56,"Windfallen if you try antidepressants and you're right, you're not depressed, you can just come off them again.If however this IS partly a depression, they may lift the corners just enough for you to see a way forward.Worth a try, I'd say.Get some easy snacks in. Cereal bars, porridge, cheese and crackers, smoothies? Stuff you can easily nourish yourself with. If you're running on empty physically you will also run on empty emotionally and mentally."
whycantwegoonasthree,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:45:02,"I think circumstances can be so shit and that a perfectly natural reaction to that is to feel depressed. ie. You may be quite right that it's a natural reaction to a catalogue of shit. But it is still a reaction that you can get help with. And meds can help, they really can, as well as a proper amount of talking therapies. (Possibly a different one though - the one you described sounds like - well, at the very least not the right fit for you.)It doesn't meant that there's anything inherently wrong with you - in that any or all of us may have felt the same as you after what you've been through. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't seek help to cope with everything that's happened.That's also a perfectly natural thing to do.It's not your fault. And you may not be able to do anything about the circumstances but you can seek help to address your feelings and reactions to the circumstances.It doesn't mean you're 'faulty'. It just means you've had too much to cope with and rightly need some help.Good luck.x"
WindfallenArch,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:45:03,Kasparprinceofthieved I'm sorry to hear you feel sad too. I hope you feel better soon. I really don't think I've ever known what people mean when they say they feel 'joy'. Sometimes I don't feel despair. That's the best I ever feel.
Purplebluebird,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:58:55,"Oh you sound very depressed  I think your therapist must have been rubbish, they should not make you feel worse - they should give you tools to cope when things are bad. Go back to your GP, ask for ADs (seriously, they can help) and therapy with someone else, because you didn't get along with the previous one.I understand it's difficult with the job situation at the moment - perhaps you could find the energy to start a hobby? You would not get rejected in a hobby club "
WindfallenArch,Tue 04-Oct-16 15:02:43,"dont I was on citralopram for a while. I didn't feel any different after a while, but I was massively aware I felt much worse for the first two weeks. Actually suicidal. I am scared to go there again for something that I couldn't perceive was later doing any good. I feel like it would all be ok if I had a purpose and somebody, somewhere liked me. I don't feel like I need tablets - I need a chat and to contribute to something."

QuiteLikely5,Tue 04-Oct-16 19:28:48,Op the only way from here is up. If nothing changes then nothing changes. Try some vit D to make sure you are good in that dept. Your past is in the past and you cannot alter that. You do not need to let it define your future. A sad person would not be displaying the sort of behaviour that you are so I think that you may be medically depressed. Call the GP and let him decide. The horror of MH problems is that often it's only our inner self who can bring ourselves out of the situation and it takes effort to realise that. And without medication it really does boil down to mind over matter. Why not go back to college to retrain in a new career? Evening classes perhaps? A confidence building course?
Bibbidee,Wed 05-Oct-16 06:59:23,"I felt suicidal last week and I'd lost a stone in weight but I'm sure the AD's are kicking in now and I see a glimmer of hope. So what if you didn't do this and that in your life. Maybe you're a late starter? You're not too old to make a teeny weeny change? I'm taking anxiety meds, AD's and Diazapam and this is getting me through the worst of my life right now. I don't intend to stay on them all but I consider them my arm bands, keeping me afloat until I can learn to swim again. You can do anything you want to do you just need to find the strength to get up some how. Good luck to you, bless ya xxx"
junebirthdaygirl,Wed 05-Oct-16 09:10:10,Is there an organisation called Grow in your area? They are very good at helping people get on their feet again. I would leave looking for a job at the moment as you won't have the energy for it yet. Go to the doctor and spill it out. A lot of depression is reactivate. They are used to that. Also you say you're children are embarrassed by you. That's pretty regular at a certain stage but it ends and they return to normal so don't despair on that. It will pass.
Babblehag,Wed 05-Oct-16 09:32:17,"Op i really feel you need to see the doctor, get some antidepressants, explain how citralopram made you feel and they'll prescribe something different, they'll lift the fog a tiny bit at a time until you feel a bit better, they can really help, depression really is a horrible illness, you say its a catastrophy of events that have made you low, that's how depression starts in some people, other people just get it randomly, it doesn't follow a specific type of person. I agree with the pp, find a hobby, don't worry about a job just yet, It'll only add to your stress. Find a hobby that gets you out of the house, a knitting club or exersise class are usually good ones. That way you'll make new friends too. Make your task today to ring the doctor, just tell the receptionist you feel its depression, the doc will want to see you quickly, if you cant face getting out today, make the appointment for tomorrow, that's your challenge tomorrow, get up, get dressed, go docs, done. I suffer badly too, and recently been given meds, I don't even think I spoke to my doctor, I just cried, I may have mumbled prozac. I find one task a day makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something. And that i'm not so hopeless/worthless. I hope you can do this op."

Imcrackingup,Sun 09-Oct-16 21:50:33,"wind I emphasise with so much you've said. I am currently not in a good place, very similar situation to you, on meds, seeing a psychiatrist and struggling...But I was suicidally depressed a long time ago - I'm not quite that bad at the moment and I am not going back there. I can't - I'm terrified of going there again. I don't think I would survive. So I am doing everything in my power not to. It is hard but I know it can only get worse if I don't. I don't think I have a choice I think the worst thing is having too much time to think and nothing positive to think about. Is there something- anything - you can do to occupy your time/mind? Even doing puzzles or an online course - anything as long as you have something else to think about apart from you and your life. And preferably using your brain - things like gardening are good to keep busy but you also have the opportunity to think - to analyse and that isn't all a good thing. I think I would drop job hunting for now - it would give you a purpose but it could back fire. I have a very part time flexible job -work from home, not well paid, no real future. It does give me something to think about but then it also makes things harder as I struggle to do things I have to and feel like I am fucking that up to...even though there is noone really to discipline me. Lack of concentration/focus - everything - makes it so much harder -so I am frustrated and angry with myself too...for making it harder than it needs to be. What I am doing is making a real effort to make small changes...take fairy steps. It is hard -but I really don't think I have a choice -unless I just give up and I am not ready for that yet (plus I have DCs and I can't do that to them - I knew someone whose DM committed suicide - they never got over it).Which means doing little things - like I get dressed as soon as I get out of bed - not washed and dressed, not showered, not dressed enough to go out but not still in my PJs. I straighten the bed - a psychological plus. Then I waste hours staring at a computer screen - not doing my work ...playing solitaire or on MN ..anything but what I should be doing.I also try and keep the house vaguely tidy - so force myself to do certain jobs on certain days. Nothing huge - just hoover one room, empty the bins, etc. Then I feel like I've achieved something. Also I have lots (hundreds!) of silly little jobs like tidy a kitchen drawer - I have them on a to do list -I add to it when I see something and try and do one every few days/week. Ticking it off a list and seeing things ticked off also lets you know what you have achieved. I also try and reorganise things like drawers - something to think about whilst doing them. I have also been trying to force myself to walk rather than drive to the local shop (10-15mins in total). Exercise is really good for your mental health but again it lets your mind wander - I have been walking fighting back the tears, feeling terrible. And frightened that I felt like carrying on walking- I was thinking about someone who did that - committed suicide in a remote but beautiful place and they walked miles to get there. You really have to do something /anything - no matter what, no matter how small to start moving forward...don't worry about the past - you can't change it. Don't worry about the future just now. Worry about surviving - and you can deal with the future when you are stronger. Don't let yourself think about anything but here and now and tiny positive achievementsI fucking hate Depression - it is hell . But I know it can pass and you will be able to find small amounts of happiness -just it is hard to believe that "
gratesnakes,Sun 09-Oct-16 22:15:29,"Hello OP, please go to a GP. Print out some of your posts here for them to read if you think you will struggle to explain yourself. Tell them that you would like to try different meda and different therapy this time. You sound really depressed but you can get better I am sure. My sister was a professional type but struggled to find work in recent years due to depression. Anti depressants have really worked for her so there really is hope. She did not want to go back into a competitive workplace and she now works part time as a carer for old people and she finds it very satisfying.You are probably much too young to be menopausal but if you have any reason to suspect that you are you could also mention that to the GP."
LifeAsWeKnowIt,Sun 19-Feb-17 23:33:26,"I am in desperate need of help. I'm 21 All my life I have had trouble with so many things; I used to self harm I am severely depressed (on tablets) Have anxiety to the max (also on tablets) I cannot tell the time unless it's 12hr I don't know my left and rights I have the shortest attention span My short term memory is atrocious I often get my words muddled up when talking I'm over sensitive to noise (I hate the cinema and nightclubs) I'm impulsive, I need things yesterday!! I have barely any sense of time, speed, distance etc. I find it hard to follow instructions (my mum used to ask my to run upstairs get her 2 things and I'd always forget) I'm always late and forget the most important things such as my theory test even though I've got it written down and panic that id forget I talk excessively to the point I feel like I am going to explode I can't spell for shit. Without autocorrect and google it would look like a 6 year old wrote this I procrastinate to the extreme I have trouble staying motivatedMy school reports were ""So and So is clever but is easily distracted, she needs to apply herself more and work harder"" I left school with 1 GCSE and I feel I was failed! I had extra lessons outside of school as well. I was tested for dyslexia in college came back I had it but it was never noted nor taken into account. I was suspended often and had a lot of dentitions. I really do want to learn but I could never understand and if I didn't get it I never did but if I got it I excelled. Anyway I really need to get a diagnosis as I'm doing a degree from home and I need to be able to put down my problems so my tutor is aware and it is taken into account unlike at school. It's a struggle when people think you are dumb, maybe I am but I need help either way! Thank you if you got this far, I hope someone can guide me in the right direction. Also my parents put it down to me being 'dumb' so that is all I've known to be but I think there is a big underlying problem."
NataliaOsipova,Mon 20-Feb-17 20:45:06,"Please don't worry, OP. I'm a SAHM and my DCs had fish fingers for supper and the house looks like a bomb has gone off in it....Seriously - don't worry. Do the best you can - in your own way - for your family and don't give anyone else a second thought. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. I'm brilliant at arranging trips out...but bloody hopeless at doing baking and crafts, for example. Focus on what you are good at.Plus - you say these are new friends you made through your child's school? Give it time. Everyone bigs themselves up at first, partly through fear as, really, you don't all necessarily have anything in common at all - you've just met because you have kids in the same class. So it's bound to be a bit strained at first and so you do see the slightly ""forced"" side of people. If you carry on being friends with them, you'll be having very different conversations this time next year, I'm sure."
Pollyanna9,Sun 19-Feb-17 10:56:46,"Hi all.I've had anxiety since childhood (watching parents rowing (not on the water you understand!!) was enough to trigger that and I suppose if you wanted to label it, you could describe me as a 'high functioning' anxious person! What I mean by that is I push myself very hard to go out to work and to push myself in what can be called my 'career' - I could settle for much easier jobs but I prefer to push myself not least because I'm the main breadwinner (single parent) and have to meet all of the related financial obligations.Where you would see my anxiety would be the fact that I compulsively pick my skin so it's damaged and scarred, that if I'm going somewhere not in the normal run of journeys/destinations I plan it out to the nth degree reviewing parking, looking on streetview so I'll recognise the entrance, reviewing the parking costs and payment methods, looking at the route etc etc etc etc.When I was about 17 I discovered alcohol and the wondrous joy of being so pissed you can be at a distance from your stress and the CONSTANT feeling of heightened concern about everything. Of course I wasn't diagnosed with this when I was a child and I didn't realise what it was for a long long time. When I had my DS I was off the charts anxious resulting in me trying to control every aspect of his care (never possible with a newborn) and it ramped up to a level I couldn't believe. I would also be anxious if the kids were say jumping on the bed - in CASE they fell off and hurt themselves - again, anxiety level way over and above anything that is normal. As I say, you'd not necessarily know this is how I am if you see me/met me. But all of this I suppose trying to suppress it is working less and less and my skin picking is going mental and I just feel so hyped up all the time I can barely relax at all. I sleep badly and wake exhausted.I want to go to the GP to get something medicinal to address this. I'm not depressed - but I do need something to 'take the edge off'. What is the likelihood of getting beta blockers prescribed or there was another drug someone said on here (darn, can't remember it) that not only does it make you feel calmer but it also helps you sleep, begins with m....It's just my GPs are often SO averse to actually DOING anything for you it drives me bloody mad. I did go in about anxiety once before and was offered referral to a mental health service but it would have resulted in going to regular sessions for CBT or similar and to be honest, the thought of having to try and organise that, take time off work and so on just makes me even more stressed! I'd like to manage it in another way.So I guess I'm asking what are the key things I need to get across that are most likely to result in the GP actually taking my request seriously and looking at a prescribing route? What is it that makes them think oh ok this person needs this type of solution and I'm happy to get them it rather than let me suggest other options and not be happy to suggest ones involving drugs?I know it's never preferable to be put on pills but for myself, it would be preferable to feeling like this every day of my life."
Pollyanna9,Sun 19-Feb-17 11:55:07,"Thank you. I feel like I'm at the point where waiting weeks for CBT plus the weeks it would take for it to work, are not going to address quickly enough, at this time, the crushing exhaustion that goes with being anxious all the time. I do absolutely agree with CBT being the premier solution but a. the timing's not right it won't be quick enough and b. unless there are remote access options certainly at the moment, it would be a no go for me at this time (but am certainly not ruling it out for sure).I think I'm so bloody anxious about going in there and just being turned back round again that I don't know what to say to convince them that I do need some immediate help to get me over a hump. Went in there for neck pain I've had on and off for 30 years. Got told a few (pathetic) neck exercises (""roll your neck, shrug your shoulders) and if that doesn't work well, you'll have to live with it..."" !! Actually, it was postural - I had to pay to see my local fantastic physio who sorted the whole thing out for me. So my experience of the GP is that they are largely extremely unhelpful and not wanting to action actual treatments.Last time I went in about anxiety I had to be assessed at a special panel because that CCG didn't commission MH support for people who skin picked - apparently I would have gotten an immediate referral if I was cutting!Honestly. I do resent that I look after myself 99% of the time. When I go the GP it's because I've got to the point where I actually need help. And so often I either don't get it or there are barriers and I come out feeling worse than when I went in. Going to the GP could make you feel depressed when you were fine when you went in!"
Woollymammoth63,Sun 19-Feb-17 15:08:38," Ho Pollyanna sorry to hear you are feeling so anxious. It's horrible and I have been there. GPs are not MH experts and some are better than others in terms of their understanding and communication. In terms of diazepam, it can be given short term in patients considered safe physically ( not at risk eg pneumonia) , not interacting with other medications, and short term relief only, and in someone who is not suicidal.it is risky as diazepam etc are addictive, and can cause depression of breathing etc. so it is at the individual GPs discretion if he feels this is safe, and a good idea. Alternative might be an antidepressant , but again a check that the person is not suicidal, and letting them know that Ads can (but don't always )make these feelings worse, usually for a few weeks in which case to immediately seek medical help. I would think see what they say, you don't have to wait for a routine appt, you can ask for the on call doctor, who usually will call you back and then probably ask to see you. It's tricky, but I would think counselling/ CBT would help , I would think it worth considering to go along with the mental health team counselling referral. Have you looked at online mindfulness, mood juice, no panic, Mind website, I think there might be a MInd helpline, and the Samaritans. Don't despair, this will improve, you will get help, but if you feel you need urgent help go through AE or out of hours GP who will get you the crisis team or AE. The GP can refer you direct to the crisis team if he felt you were in distress, it's really best to be honest and discuss with him/ her. All the best"
Imogenblue,Mon 20-Feb-17 00:11:38,"This may not go down well, I don't know, I'm just stuck and unsure as to what I should do.Diagnosed with depression and anxiety, always been told to take meds for it but never have. One primary reason is that I continually worry about side affects (I don't even take pain killers). Another -probably lesser reason to many people- is what happened when I was given a prescription for some at the pharmacy and was taken into a small room. Basically, I was told I needed to be an active person or I was going to put on a lot of weight on the meds. Really not what you want to hear when already depressed. However, the only exercise I can do is walking (various problems, waiting for physio) and not for long. So, this weight gain comment really puts me off taking something, as someone who already has body image issues.Is this silly? Should I suck it up?"
Itisnoteasybeingdifferent,Mon 20-Feb-17 05:26:36,If you have genuine problems doing exercise (plantar faciatis etc) I suggest you soeak to GP about an altnative med. No point in putting on weight and becoming more immobile then more depressed because you are putting on weight.
wantoscreamatwashingpile,Mon 20-Feb-17 17:39:09,"Just wondering if anyone has had any good effects with it really? I'd say I'm probably more anxious than depressed (it ebbs and flows). I've never tried anything from the drs (apart from beta blockers, which I have before presentations ) Xx"
oregon1985,Sun 12-Feb-17 14:39:20,"But I don't know what to say. I think I'm depressed or something, I don't know. I've always been, I guess down is the right word. As long as I can remember I've always felt like it would be better if I weren't here. But the last month has been tough (end of relationship with the love of my life, though we're working through it we're not back together).I'm not coping very well. I can't do anything, I have no motivation. I spent the last few days just staring blankly at the tv. I have random hours a few days a week where I feel like I'm might be ok, I get positive and a small amount of motivation then it's right back to feeling empty. I can't blame my relationship ending on this because it's been like this forever but it's intensified a lot the last few weeks. Most days I'll just sit by myself all day. I can barely bring myself to get up and shower. I don't talk to anyone. I just sit here. At work in very good at putting on a cheery front. People think I'm bubbly and friendly but it's all just so people don't ask me if I'm ok, because I feel like I will break down if someone knows how I really feel. I feel broken. And empty. I know I should probably talk to the dr but I don't know what to say. I've never been good at talking to people face to face and I feel pathetic."
Latara,Mon 23-Jul-12 10:51:24,"I'm on 225mg Venlafaxine M/R daily - it took 3 months to work properly so you have to be patient - but it's definitely been worth it & i recommend trying it!I still get short depressive periods (& feel suicidal at times) for an hour or a few hours during mood swings (got BPD). Often this happens daily; but as soon as the depressive period passes off i feel ok, like i was never depressed.Like today; i feel very happy & lively.If you have epilepsy - be aware that Venlafaxine lowers the seizure threshold - that's the one side effect that is a problem for me - i don't get full tonic-clonic seizures thanks to my epilepsy meds, but it's not fully controlled. So i get very short absence, myoclonic & deja vu seizures daily; & those seizures contribute to memory loss which is frustrating... Oh yes & best to avoid alcohol, even 1 glass of wine stops Venlafaxine being effective for me for up to 2 days later.You may feel hungrier so snack on apples / Ryvita & jam - nothing fattening.I'm happy to put up with less controlled epilepsy though as it means not getting the horrible depression i had; just would not wish bad depression on anyone.Good luck, you definitely should try it - i don't remember any other side effects but you may get drowsy etc for a while - but hopefully that will wear off after few weeks."
confusedandemployed,Mon 23-Jan-17 12:52:41,"I think you need an advocate. Contact CAB, they will help as much as possible and will be able to signpost you to other organisations that can help. It will be MUCH easier to deal with all the official / financial stuff if you're not alone.And GP obviously. You are chronically depressed and need urgent help. "
Flowersandcats,Mon 23-Jan-17 13:33:03,"And chuck them pain killers away !!!I'm not sure how to explain this (like I said I am having trouble distinguishing real feelings/memories from false feelings/memories atm). I understand that there is a difference as far as health service provision is concerned between ""feeling suicidal"" and ""having a plan in place to end your life"". I think when I bought the tablets (5 shops, 100+ paracetamol) it was with the idea of ending my life. But right now, there is something oddly comforting in the thought that if I did need immediate psychiatric help, I could point to the paracetamol and say ""Plan in place!""I do want to end it. But in a ""never having existed in the first place"" way. If I could wipe out my existence so no-one ever knew I existed, I would do that in a heartbeat. But I can't. I have to keep reminding myself that killing myself would be far worse for my daughter than any of the other shitty possible outcomes of my current situation."
TENSHI,Thu 26-Jan-17 10:07:37,"Let me tell you something I did when overwhelmed, depressed and couldn't cope at all.I had young dc and a business. I preferred just to stuff any brown envelopes under the sofa or in a cupboard.One day I had a letter from the tax office asking to see my accounts of the last 3 years as part of a random survey. I can't tell you how much it threw me into a panic. I was unable to sleep and just ignored it. The next sequence of events remain hazy. I got a call from the tax office as I had failed to turn up to the meeting (I think). They asked me for my figures for the last year and I just plucked a figure out of thin air and told them.As I'm not sure the sequence of events, may be they asked to see me/the accounts.. well I knew I couldn't justify any of it so I just rang them up and confessed that I had just put a random figure down and actually had no idea what the real amount was as I didn't know and I was too upset to find out.They were absolutely marvellous. Told me not to worry, to gather all the paper work that I had and just bring it all in for them to sort out for me.I saw the kindliest lady and the kindliest fatherly sort of gentleman at the tax office in the next few weeks while they went through it all with me and told me next time I was struggling to just come in and ask for help. That they were trying to change the face of their work and it needn't be a scary place.So please don't despair as I did and put it off. Just confess and admit you're in a pickle/mess/overwhelmed/cannot cope and you will be surprised how your frankness and honesty will disarm people and you will see their compassionate side.Good luck "
Flowersandcats,Mon 30-Jan-17 19:59:31,"It's just over a week since I wrote my original post. I was feeling so fucking hopeless at that point. It seemed impossible that there was any way out of my situation. I don't know how it's all going to pan out, obviously. But the difference between how I was feeling then and how I am feeling now is huge. I know everyone says that it's better once you face up to things but I couldn't bring myself to do it. It's totally true though. I even managed to get through the whole CAB appointment without crying.No post today. I actually enjoy checking the mailbox and finding it empty. It did occur to me opening all my unopened post (some of it dating back to 2014) that if I didn't owe people money and have DDs constantly bouncing in my bank account, I'd barely get any postal correspondence at all.And thanks for your post bigmouthstrikesagain. People who volunteer at CAB are total fucking heroes."
Ladybird1979,Sat 18-Feb-17 09:18:03,Don't just stop it. It takes 2 weeks to work into your system so be patient. You need to be weaned off - i had exactly same issue but no one told me I couldn't just stop taking them. I ceased and became suicidal and self harmed badly.Please don't just stop go to see your GP.I ended up controlling my depression and anxiety through exercise which helped so much and gradually came off the pills.
meltownmary,Fri 17-Feb-17 18:51:05,"Hello,Had a devastating loss nearly four years ago. Got on with things pretty soon after. Was numb I think. Lots of other awful things happened at the same time that took up a lot of my brain space. But was kind of ok. Or so I thought.Anyway, in the last six months I am in bits with anxiety and all the rest of it. It's coming to the surface again. Shit.Went to GP yesterday in despair, and he recommended counselling. OK so far, then said I should consider Escitalopram for the anxiety. Gave me a script and I filled it, but I am full of anxiety and will not take them. I know, but that's me.I am not taking any other meds at all for anything else. He also gave me a weeks supply of 3mg Lexotan to take if I get panicky. They are god's gift, but I have to be careful not to become dependent on them.Jesus will this anxiety ever go away. It is awful.I really am banking on the counselling.Has anyone else suffered complex unresolved grief and how are you now if you did.Thanks so much."

Anaffaquine123,Wed 15-Feb-17 22:55:17,"This will be deliberately vague so no-one can be identified but hopeful will still be understandable.Family member ""A"" has for years not taken care of themselves in anyway, personal hygiene, wearing dead relatives clothes, doesn't bother getting painful sores on legs treated, finances in a mess, house an absolute tip etc. Many ""interventions"" have been staged by various family members over the years and A gets help to get things sorted a bit but before long everything is back how it was. A was the victim in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic, kids went to live elsewhere as A couldn't seem to get things sorted. A's personality is completely different to how they were a long time ago. I think the person they used to be is completely lost. The person left doesn't have much emotion about anything and is unbelievably submissive.I have for a very long time felt they were severely depressed. A is only now admitting they need help and has asked me to go to the gp with them tomorrow. A admitted they considered killing themselves today but due to another close family member being pregnant, in their words, ""won't do it yet""It is really difficult to get a dr's appointment at their surgery but I feel it must be tomorrow. Anyone got any advice? I am willing to help anyway I can but have no clue where to start. Thanks in advance."
EmeraldIsle100,Mon 13-Feb-17 15:26:20,"Does anyone experience hot and cold sweats at night? My DD aged 19 has had mental health problems since she was about 15/16 and spent the last 6 months in a psychiatic ward due to bipolar, depression, anxiety, eating disorder, self harm and suicidal ideation. She was discharged recently and is doing quite well. She is on lithium which thankfully has eliminated the suicidal ideation. She seems a lot better in herself and thankfully she is getting a break from really disturbing frightening thoughts.Her eating disorder veers between anorexia and bulimia but at the moment she seems to be eating and is not too thin. I don't really know how often she is making herself sick after food but she says it has reduced significantly. She has started to experience night sweats which are hot and then cold and she wakes up freezing. I wonder if anyone has had this problem. She is on diazapam, lithium, an anti depressant and a mood stabilizer. I would very much appreciate any advice that you may have. Thanks very much."
sabzii,Fri 10-Feb-17 19:17:50,"Yes, when I was in my late teens and depressed with anorexia. These days I'm very confident about how I look. Do you believe you actually are 'different' or is it a state of mind? Have you had any talking therapy eg CBT/NLP/counselling?You say you feel 'unpolished'. How much time do you spend grooming? Do you get your hair cut and coloured regularly, spend time blow-drying it, do your nails, shop for clothes that fit well, work out regularly? There is so much you can do to achieve the 'look' you want. Grooming and dressing well are skills you can learn. What is it about your appearence you dislike?"
neveradullmoment99,Fri 10-Feb-17 20:52:42," Honestly, beauty can come just as much from within. You have to learn to love yourself or even like yourself. I have met plenty people in my life time who are not stunningly beautiful or even pretty but they are such lovely people that they exude beauty and are just lovely to be around. I am also quite sure you are not as bad as you think you are. You have youth on your side too. You need to focus on other things that make you happy and as for your looks, focus on the parts you like and those that you dislike try to make the best of. I am wondering if you are a bit depressed. Maybe a bit of depression is making you feel so bad about yourself. Maybe because you feel lonely, you are focusing on your looks when in reality you are a bit depressed that in turn can make you feel down, lonely and unhappy and you are maybe blaming how others interact with you on your looks? Just a thought. Maybe worth trying to confront what is upsetting you deep down? Could you talk to the doctor about how you feel?"
crazydogladyo,Thu 16-Feb-17 02:14:40,"I feel exactly the same but without the suicidal ideation. I've only started feeling like it again recently though. I was doing a lot better. I do take 50mg Sertraline for anxiety, but it doesn't seem to help with this."

If I messaged between sessions she would always reply but wouldn't engage which I totally respected as you can counsel over text, she would advise me to come in face to face. I have reached out as you have in despair a few times. She always replied promptly. I would feel very hurt in your posistion.

Lilipops,Mon 13-Feb-17 17:55:44,"I have been taking a low dose of Prozac (fluoxetine) for a good few years and generally I think they help. However, although I am much more tolerant and calm about things, I just feel slightly that I am not 'me'. I definitely get on with my husband much better when I'm on them as I don't question anything, I.e. Problems within our relationship. I am not sure if I am depressed as opposed to just not happy and taking them just numbs everything. I feel that when I come off them (I have just run out and so haven't taken any for a few days) I am much less accepting of things in my life. I wonder if I stop taking them I might do something about my life as I will feel the need to sort things out. I might push my husband to try to go to marriage counselling or something rather than just trudging along as we are. I don't know where to go or who to talk to for help. I don't know if I will be wasting the doctors time if I make an appointment to talk to them about it as ultimately it's my decision. I have never told any of my friends that I take them as I'm basically ashamed of the stigma of them."

I'm not an expert on this but in case it helps I have recently had some CBT (I didn't have severe problems/suicidal thoughts or anything but I felt myself starting to lose my grip and didn't want it going out if control). It was scary thinking about it because i sort of didn't want to confront myself. I wasn't sure what the problem was exactly, except that I didn't like myself and wasn't happy that I was (over)reacting badly to things and had got myself stuck in a pattern of behaviour I could see but not stop. My therapist asked me some questions and we picked a particular place to start and went from there. It really helped me although it was a bit scary to start with. I feel like I have tools to spot the behaviour patterns I was stuck in and alter them. I'm so glad I did it. I hope you get an appointment soon and it helps."
NotJanine,Mon 13-Feb-17 11:42:06,"I have been suffering from mild depression and anxiety for a while now, relating to my marriage and subsequent split.I did get a prescription for anti-depressents but I couldn't bear the side-effects and stopped taking them. My main problem at the moment is anxiety and it is becoming overwhelming for me. I am going to see a counsellor which I hope will help. I know the theory behind anxiety and am fine at giving other people advice on coping, but can't do it myself.Beta blockers were mentioned to me before but the gp said they might not be suitable for me as my blood pressure is naturally quite low. However I'm starting to feel quite desparate as the anxiety is building and although I don't feel depressed as I was, I do feel it's all getting too painful to cope with and I am worried about feeling suicidal again.So I'd be interested to hear about anyone's experiences of BBs. Side effects, how effective have they been, have they lowered your BP, are they easy to come off?Thanks"
Jaytee38,Tue 14-Feb-17 00:37:36, I've no idea where you can get it. However I think studies have shown it increases suicidal thoufhts/ideation so not safe to go on if not under the care of a doctor.
Saloire,Mon 13-Feb-17 02:11:28,"Sorry, a bit of a long post coming up:  So, I'm 32 weeks pregnant, due in April. I have a history of postnatal depression, plus winter depression which has recurred since my DD (now five years old) was born, and currently battle with insomnia. I'm not on any medication for any of these, but i'm not averse to it in the future.  So in December, my mum had a breakdown, and is relying on me relatively heavily for emotional support over the phone as I am 500 miles away so can't go to see her due to work and my daughter's school pick ups and drop-offs etc. Mum is currently on sertraline, and is also receiving CBT, but it doesn't seem to be making any difference. She phoned me today to say she felt suicidal and she just couldn't cope any more. I really don't know what to do to help her, and her whole demeanour plus the things she talks about are acting as a massive trigger for me. I hate seeing her like this, it makes me feel sad, makes me feel guilty for not being there, and it also makes me realise what I look like when I'm in that state, and I never want to go back there again. Of course the fear of all this is making me not sleep, which normally starts the cycle of anxiety for me. I've been bingeing on sugar to try and numb the anxious feelings, have been running away from doing anything remotely CBT or meditation related as it just reminds me of how it's not working for my mum. I've been trying to mask my feelings from my partner, so as not to make him feel like my mum is making me feel right now. I know he would be supportive, but I just don't want to cause him the same horrible feelings I get when I look at my mum.  I know I'm not helping myself, but I'm just a lost as to what to do and in what order. So, should I be phoning the doctor on my mum's behalf to tell him she's not getting any better and that she needs to up her dose of antidepressants, or should I be looking after myself first, admitting to my feelings and tackling my sugar addiction? My baby is due in under eight weeks, and I feel unprepared emotionally for what I know is to come. I feel I should be managing everything better in terms of looking after my mental health, and I know I'm not, there's just so much going on right now and I don't know where to start.  Thanks for reading if you got this far XXX"
AnxiousCarer,Mon 13-Feb-17 17:23:02,"Speaking from experience put yourself and your (and babys) health first. If you go under then you can't support anyone else, and right now you need to be getting in the best place mentally yourself for when baby arrives.Definately share with DP. DH and I both have mental health problems and have learnt the hard way that trying to protect each other by keeping them to our selves generally backfires spectacularly!Your DM is obviously having a really hard time at the moment, but she is an adult and she needs to be the one going back to her GP and discussing how she is feeling, including the suicidal feelings. Make sure she has the samaritans number, and knows that she can go to A&E or contact crisis team, if she feels she needs to. I also think you need to set some boundries with her. Explain kindly that you are struggling yourself and can't offer her the support you would like to at the moment. Maybe set days and times when you will or wont be available. I know when my DM was going through a hard time a few years ago I wouldn't always answer the phone, if I didn't feel up to it."
UnbornMortificado,Mon 13-Feb-17 11:44:27,I'll give you a bump.https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/feeling_depressed/2824437-Could-we-have-a-general-mental-illness-support-threadThat is a general MH support thread you might get some better information on CBT and other options on there.
DeleteOrDecay,Wed 11-Jan-17 01:03:59,"Great idea for a threadI have been depressed and anxious for a long long time, I can't actually pinpoint a time where it all began but it's got progressively worse over the years and I think I've been in denial about the state of my mental health. Last week, with the support of my dp I finally plucked up the courage to see my GP who was understanding and I have been on 50mg sertraline for 5 days so far. For some reason I had this irrational fear that I would be brushed off or that I was just being dramatic so I kept putting off going to the doctors. Wish I'd gone sooner now.Been having quite a few side effects from the meds such as dry mouth, unsettled sleep, tiredness, loss of appetite, feeling restless/fidgety, feeling 'strange' and more panicky. The GP did say this could happen for the first few weeks but despite the above side effects I do feel like the meds have been helping. I definitely feel less depressed, I haven't had as many negative thoughts, I've felt more motivated about doing stuff around the house and I mostly feel I've been less snappy with dp and the kids although I still have my moments. I know it can take time for them to kick in fully.Fingers crossed once the side effects wear off I continue to make improvements. I feel like I'm actually starting to feel normal now and life seems to be more bearable, which is weird as I had forgotten what normal feels like."
Testificateman,Wed 11-Jan-17 19:58:49,"Hi Lollipop. Work has been quite stressful but, managed to cope, some how.I've not been too bad for a few weeks now.Was bad in the run up to Christmas, very suicidal thoughts. Thinking of the best way to do it and make it look like an accident.Nearly 30 years now since my first attempt. Fucking long time."
MeadowHay,Wed 11-Jan-17 22:58:29,"Welcome everyone . Delete Well done on going to see your GP, that is a big step and means you are on your way to recovery. Good luck with the sertraline, it can take 4-5 weeks for antidepressants to really start working so stick with it and side-effects mostly wear off after the first couple of weeks too for most people. When I first started citalopram a few years ago I was dreadfully ill for the first week with a vast array of side effects, they gradually lessened in the second week and then most of them went away bar a few trivial things and then the medicine really helped me for a few years. Lollipop Glad your placement is still going well. I went to see my dad this evening and had a nice meal out with him which was nice. Tomorrow morning I have an appointment with my study advisor at uni which DH is going to take me to to make sure I actually go and help me talk to her in case I can't talk due to anxiety. It will be about my presentation and to see if there is anything she can do to help me with it . Testi Christmas is often a particularly tough time for people. I too felt particularly suicidal in the run up to it and made my first plans in awhile. Which I have now abandoned thankfully."
Rueben,Wed 11-Jan-17 23:11:51,"Hello all! Great thread idea. I can relate to a lot of what has been said. I have depression and anxiety, and I'm a first year uni student. Finding it hard to cope with uni - I have an incredibly short concentration span and haven't socialised or made any friends (I live at home) I'm embarrassed to admit I can't always find the motivation to get dressed everyday. I haven't left my house at all except to see a CBT practitioner (every Friday). I've only had 2 sessions so I can't say whether it's effective yet. Overall, I feel very lost and hopeless. I don't really know what to do anymoreI have a uni exam tomorrow but my mind is completely blank and detached, instead worrying about other things"
DeleteOrDecay,Fri 13-Jan-17 22:58:20,"Yes you're right Meadow, I've only been on them a week so why I'm worrying about coming off them already I don't know. I do tend to worry about things that don't don't matter.Glad your advisor was nice Lollipop, I bet that made all the difference. I definitely couldn't cope in a sales or call centre role so I understand where you're coming from with that. Work can be a massive factor when it comes to MH.Today was okay up until this evening where I felt what I can only describe as a black could descend upon me. It begun when we went out for a meal, the food was disappointing, dp is giving up smoking and didn't put a nicotine patch on so has been quite unpleasant this afternoon which in turn made me act unpleasant back (I didn't know he hadn't put a patch on) as I couldn't understand what his problem was and his mood was making me anxious.Haven't had that feeling since starting the meds, not sure if it's due to the meds or if it was just coincidental as I do go through phases of feeling 'okay'. Not brilliant by any means, but sort of 'stable'. Does anyone else? I mean more often than not I definitely feel I am depressed but have occasions where I'm not so bad. Had a little cry tonight as I felt dp was being unsupportive, but that's a whole other thread. Hopefully tomorrow will be better."
SarcasmMode,Sun 15-Jan-17 10:17:00,"Great idea for a thread - thought about starting one myself.Anxiety and depression is my main thing. I have been depressed since about 10 or 11, low mood before too. Lots of little things have happened. I'm on Srtralinw and been on ADs since 12.Hello everyone else"
UnbornMortificado,Sun 15-Jan-17 15:21:57,Quark I think that is classed as suicidal intentions sort of. It's wanting to commit suicide without having plans to currently do so.The pregnancy would be classed as a protective factor. Have we spoke on a thread earlier?Has any one had any luck with self care?Purple I think anxiety is worse to have then bi-polar personally. I've suffered with both and it's the anxiety that fucks me up more.
bellatrixlestrange124,Mon 16-Jan-17 15:01:12,"Hi, I'm another new one! I have anxiety and depression, though I'm never sure when one ends and the other one starts with me!I've started a new job recently, it's high pressure and there's a lot to do, but because of my anxiety I spend so much of the time feeling frozen with fear and am unable to get on with anything. Which then means my to do list gets bigger and I feel more and more overwhelmed. And then I get depression that I can't even do the simple things that I know I can do. It all feels so hopeless and I'm so unhappy. And then I get chased for things and I feel even more panicked. I don't want to lose my job over this, I worked so hard to get it.Purple could you link me to the FB group too please?"
MeadowHay,Wed 25-Jan-17 08:39:39,"mrsdarcy Glad you've found a new counsellor who is more supportive of you. I agree when you have severe anxiety/agoraphobia you need to take baby steps and recognise all your achievements. It can be really hard. I can't really go anywhere on my own other than uni and work - which is the same place as I work in my SU. It is horrible feeling trapped at home sometimes. Rachie Sorry to hear you're feeling bad anxiety-wise. If you're really struggling, make that GP appt, they can help you. Inside Also sorry to hear how low you're feeling, please try to keep safe. If you need to talk you can call Samaritans remember or if you're in urgent crisis situation you can call 999 or go to A&E. If you are feeling so suicidal I agree it's a good idea to go to see your GP urgently so they can help you. I know how it feels to feel that awfully law, I hope today seems a little better.  I am up so early this morning and feel not too exhausted/sleepy which is a big achievement. I am about to go to work now. I have to sit on a stall today later at work with a couple of other students and entice people to come and talk to me and ask them things, eeeeeek. Really anxious but I won't be on my own so will give it my best shot and keep taking deep breaths!"
goneloopy,Sun 12-Feb-17 11:24:38,"Brief history - SAHM, 2DC, DH, been on AD on and off for years. Currently on sertraline 100mg. Been doing ok on it, but recently started feeling very low again, tired all the time, isolating myself from family and friends, don't even want to leave the house. Don't know why I'm posting really, just wanted to get it out so to speak. Should I go back to my GP? Just want to shake this feeling of apathy and tiredness. I don't want my DC to have such a bad mother who doesn't want to take them places, who has no motivation to leave the house. I am drifting further and further away from my DH too. We barely speak, just co exist. I'm just tired of it all. I'm not suicidal as I'd never do that to my DC but I can see how easy it would be for that to happen. "

LuluBlue,Tue 01-Mar-11 18:08:44,"This morning I made my first post on another thread (on being nonmaternal), before I found this one. I am 38 yrs old, 8 weeks pregnant with my first and am horribly depressed and ambivalent. I have never felt maternal, had sworn off children-- a choice that my husband (who is much more a ""broody type"") respected, while most likely harboring the hope that I would someday see the light. Well, here I am, entering the 2nd month of an unplanned pregnancy and I am just nothing but blind-terrified of everything I read in this thread-- because it resonates, all of it. The loss of self, the depression, the resentment. I nodded so much as I read--the idea that parenthood in general is a sort of conspiracy... I just wanted to say that I am grateful for everyone's candor. What you are confirming are the worst fears I have for motherhood myself. I have friends who swear up and down that they felt as I did but then the baby arrived and -- poof!--it's been nothing but rainbows and chickadees ever since. I know that they are probably also shielding me from the worst of it, for both of our sakes. That said, I also truly believe that some women are meant to be mothers-- that they really have that ""calling."" That they enjoy it naturally and weather the lumps and bumps of it so much easier that types like me who never felt remotely interested in the first place. I know that even posting these thoughts anonymously could not have been easy, since to admit maternal regret is the last bastion of taboo in this very childcentric world. I hope many of the women here can feel better just for knowing that they are far from alone in their thoughts. And I just want to say, to InPraiseofBacchus and others, that this thread HAS made a difference. To me anyway. It is not yet too late for me, though time is wasting. I think I have decided for good to terminate and will make the appointment today. I do hope somenone might respond to this, if only to let me know that my thougts, too, were heard. My best to you all."

I am hoping that in a week or so that the clouds will begin to lift and I will be able to decipher whether I am merely depressed in general (I have a history of depression) or if the pregnancy is the root cause of it. She urged me to give it some time to make my decision. I will do so, but do feel, each day, that time is ""running out.""

WearyMumof3,Sun 12-Feb-17 19:12:44,"Hello,As the subject says, tomorrow I'm at the Drs, I've tried going several times over the past few years with several set backs, I guess what I'm looking for from mumsnet is some encouragement and words of wisdom so I don't turn into my usual quiet self and don't get my point across to the gp...Ever since my early teens I have suffered with depression, I seem to have one to two weeks of being ok then I sink into a heavy depression and feel suicidal. I was put onto fluoxetine at 14 for about a year.. my parents (my mother) didn't know what to do with me, I was in and out of hospital, didn't finish school and was sent to live with grandparents...Through a stroke of luck I met my husband and started to build my life, we fell pregnant with my now 9yo son... after he was born I had severe PND, I was referred and saw a counsellor but was told i could only have one session, I think that set off my dislike of mental health support on the NHS, how I feel towards my son is different compared to my younger 2, he has high functioning autism which I know is my fault and my inability to love him as I know I should since birth... I do love him of course but I don't feel like I know him and often wish my husband would leave me and take my eldest with him... I didn't feel like this with my younger two but it I did notice the difference in how I felt about my eldest- I took myself to the Drs and was told to call samaritans... I went back and was given an appointment for talking mental health Derbyshire, that appointment was cancelled on the morning I was due to go and they couldn't offer me another one at the time. So I've spent the last year just plodding along.Here and now after my periods returned in the summer and my husband had the snip last year I've noticed that my monthly severe depression is back, I've been using an app to track my moods and cycles, I feel suicidal in the week or so leading up to my period, my mood settles somewhat but still extremely anxious and easily wound up... it looks like premenstrual dysphoric disorder is what has been my problem for the past 14 years, but how do I go about getting help, do I ask for help treating that in hope it will tie in the on going pnd and the lack of bond I have with my eldest? What do I do if I'm fobbed off with the samaritans again? I'm desperate to help and to feel well, I may not have described my issues eloquently here but this it what they are in a nutshell, what help should I be asking for?"
kerstina,Sun 12-Feb-17 10:57:09, Sorry I am so late replying I have had a week from hell so poorly ended up in hospital A&E three times . Got so dehydrated had to have a drip as was choking and gagging couldn't eat or drink anything for a week . So disappointed with my doctor as the only help he offered to help with withdrawal was an app for my phone then when I felt like I was dying more or less said he didn't believe it was anxiety that I must be physically ill as I looked so unwell. So much for mental health being a priority they don't want to know unless you are suicidal . How are you now mummy squirrel please keep in touch ?
UpOnDown,Tue 17-Jan-17 19:39:49," I'm suicidal. My CMHT know, they phoned this morning, visited this afternoon and offered to phone later too. Surely this is too much? How long will they keep contacting me?"
MagicChanges,Wed 18-Jan-17 20:39:37,"I think the problem is that mental health Trusts are totally short of money and so there is an acute and chronic shortage of beds. Our local Trust has closed a whole dementia ward and cut beds on acute wards by 50% so they are using CPNs or other members of CMHTs to visit daily for patients who really need to be in hospital. They have a term for it here ""Wards without Walls"" - you couldn't make it up!!Incidentally OP it isn't only ""hearing voices"" that prompts an admission. It's true that if someone is suffering a psychotic illness (with hearing voices being a symptom) and is not taking the meds, they may need to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The nature of this illness is that people are deluded so are convinced they are not ill and it's the people around them who are deluded! In such a state they need to be protected for themselves and others. A person can be sectioned if they are a danger to themself or others, and this can be the case for any mental illness.Crisis teams in my experience are not much help - in our MH Trust they will simply tell someone to go to A & E as there is a MH liaison post in A & E. which I suppose is better than nothing. Mind a person would almost certainly have to wait for an age for the the MH liaison person. Of course staff are in a very difficult position knowing that there are no beds available for people who are in desperate need. They will try other hospitals in the trust or further afield, but it's just not right that patients have to travel 30 or more miles away from their home, which can be the case.Upondown do you mind my asking about your mental illness - am assuming it is depression as suicidal thoughts are very common with this illness. Do you mean you are having these thoughts (known as suicide ideation) but don't really think you will act upon them, or is it more serious, and you have made plans. It sounds like it could be the latter as the CMHT are in close contact. Please take all the help you can get. Hope you have someone close at hand who understands the torment of mental illness and can support you."
iveburntthetoast,Sat 11-Feb-17 12:00:35," Yep, I've noticed my CT becoming more stretched and increasing the level of 'crisis' you need to be in. It's not enough to be suicidal--or even to have plans. You just about have to be in the process of killing yourself for them to intervene. Not to mention the state you need to be in to get a hospital bed....."
ovumahead,Thu 08-Sep-11 13:50:38,"Hi there, I've read your thread with interest, after just coming home from the docs today with a prescription for ADs (escitalopram) - feel SO nervous about taking them because of the side effects, and reading about withdrawals on the internet. Plus i'm a bit of a hypochondriac so am always monitoring myself for symptoms of bloody anything!!! I think I'm going to start taking mine tonight, and see how I go. I'm not pregnant or breastfeeding. I think I probably should have started taking these meds years ago - have been feeling depressed on and off for a long while now. Enough is enough! Fingers crossed these meds help us both - would love to compare notes if you're up for it!!!"
friggFRIGG,Thu 08-Sep-11 16:28:38,"actually,scrap that,thats crap,i HAVE been feeling better.today ive put washing out,put another load on.hoovered.made lunch for the DC.washed up.walked DD to nursery (1hr round trip)hoovered.tidyed.started on dinner.this is (embarrassingly) roughly what i would have achieved in 2-3 days a week or two ago.(i would just have gone out immediately and had lunch in town,or done very little and stayed at home.)and the day isnt over yet,i feel more able,when i look around the house at the things i need to do,instead of despairing,and doing nothing,i START.my DD and i are clashing less.some of this is down to DD starting nursery this week.some of it isnt."
unlucky83,Thu 14-Jul-16 23:46:12,"I'm awaiting an appointment in Aug with psychiatry to get assessed and hopefully diagnosed. DD1 was diagnosed at just 14 - but I had suspected for years. I didn't want her labelled but with exams etc looming she was starting to lose it - I thought she was going to stop going to school (which is what I did). The medication transformed her school work. But there are 2 downsides - one she only takes it for school - when it wears off at night she becomes more lively than she was before - it is kind of like a release. And at the weekend/holidays she is also harder to deal with - more bouncy and loud than ever...and in some ways she controls it less as she has an excuse/reason - she isn't trying to be 'normal' any more. Which is probably better for her metal health... but can be a nightmare for me. She is also oppositional - you have to carefully phrase everything so she doesn't see it as an 'order' ... if she feels like you are telling her to do something she won't and the more cross you become with her the more she fights back. I'm 49 and going for a diagnosis cos I am struggling keeping on top of everything - I am the queen of procrastination...everything feels slightly out of control. I have seen what a difference medication made to DD and think if I took when I needed to I could get on top of everything for once and for all and feel happier. (I am back on ADs at the moment -struggled with depression all my life and was suicidal when I was in my 20s)I am addicted to coffee and nicotine - although I vape now on the whole - only have the odd cigarette. I cry when I haven't had a cigarette for a while - I panic and feel like I can't function. I read Allan carrs book about stopping smoking - in it he says remember how awful that first cigarette made you feel - my first cigarette made me feel great . The same is true for coffee - I drink gallons of super strong coffee every day and I really can't function without it. I then read both nicotine and caffeine have been trialled as treatments for ADHD...which was a real ahhhh I get it moment for me -before that I just thought I had an addictive personality. I only took E a couple of times (I became ill and was on serious prescription drugs when I was into that scene - so then couldn't risk it or any other illegal drugs) and it made my brain feel so focused - it was amazing - everything was so clear - I wasn't buzzing I was just super calm and together...I kind of thought that is how it made everyone feel  Only took cocaine once and it had no real noticeable effect on me...that I can remember. I'm still on prescription medication and have dodgy health so daren't risk sneaking some of DD's concerta -although I have been tempted. As to fidgeting - an acquaintance apparently thought I was an addict cos I was so fidgety, keep touching my face etc. But I have developed a technique to stop me being too fidgety. I also think DP has ADHD (doing the questionnaire for DD was when the penny dropped). The other day we were watching a (slightly tedious) school concert. He can't sit still- rocks around on his chair, wriggles, his legs are bouncing etc. I realised to all outward appearance I was sitting still - I cross my arms and legs to stop me fidgeting - but I am wriggling my toes like mad in my shoes...."
MaximilianNero,Sun 17-Jul-16 03:33:41,"I'm becoming convinced that I have ADHD as well as ASD. I did that test thing and got 6/6 and 9/12. This thread describes so much of what i experience.I have an addictive type personality...I can be completely obsesed with something, but then a switch will flip and suddenly I will completely lose all interest. I got to Candy Crush over level 1000 and then the switch flipped and I've had no desire to touch it since. If I want to stop something, it has to be cold turkey. To use the cigarette example, I am not one of those people who could cut from 20 to 15 to 10 a day and so on. It's cold turkey or nothing. I had to do that with the lottery most recently. No ability to stick to my spending limit. I constantly get hooked on researching or reading the next thing, and then move on. Never tried recreational drugs though, and never even had a cup of coffee because I hate the taste so much.I have 4 unfinished projects in my line of sight. No wait, 5Impulsive....very impulsive purchaser, cannot learn the lessons of previous stupidity. I know I should food shop on a full stomach. I KNOW I should. But I don't. Broken the law on impulse before and then thought 'oh you idiot, why'd you do that??'. Nearly get run over crossing the road because I won't wait for the green man. ""ooh, yes, I'll book flights to xyz for next week"". My pattern is always to impulsively book something and then have to frantically research to produce a tight plan to avoid extreme ASD anxiety. The sensible person would surely research first (sigh)Extremely restless and fidgety constantly. Often compelled to get up and start leaping around. Always put that solely down to ASD.Often miss part of people's sentences, cannot focus on what people are saying for long. Reread book sentences multiple times to take it in.Mind everywhere. Unless I'm obsessing on something, it's jumping from one thing to the next to the next. It's like something physically pulls my mind onto another focus, I have so little control over it  It's not necessarily any other particular thought either, it's maybe just nothing, I just slide out of focus so I'm staring at a wall with no concrete thoughts in my mind. It's this mind-everywhere and inability to concentrate that cause me difficulties work-wise. Coupled with indecision. For instance, I'm trying to choose a chocolate bar in Tesco. One of two bars. I will stand in that aisle for 10 or 15 entire minutes while I feel vaguely confused and my mind slides everywhere and then back to the chocolate bars but i have no idea which to have and can't squarely focus my mind on the bars for long, and rinse and repeat while I get more and more stressed out. Over a fecking chocolate bar.Mood swings all the time. Treated for depression before, but actually successfully, no longer clinically depressed, I just get sad mood swings. Very easily frustrated. I clean only in binges. Housework, cleaning and organisation are all or nothing events. Terrible at doing things that need doing, procrastinator extraordinaire, horrible organisation, require to-do lists to remember things, always misplacing my keys etc in my room and having to tip it upside down."
BertieBotts,Sun 24-Jul-16 20:04:29,"Interestingly the doctor who diagnosed me said she very much wanted to get me to do an intelligence test because she was very interested to see what it would say (she thinks I have very high intelligence) but the clinic didn't have the licence to one in English.I have never done a proper IQ test but I did once out of interest do an online sample quiz to join a MENSA organisation and got 98%.OMG, I could have written your post 3 years ago when I first found out about ADHD. Interestingly, though I had always thought of myself as prone to depression/suffering from depression multiple times since I was 14 (in hindsight, this was just when my ADHD started to seriously affect my life because it was when I first had to start being responsible for myself.) When I started psychotherapy/CBT my therapist asked me some questions about my depression and actually I don't, and have never, fitted the DSM criteria for it. That astounded me. Similarly for anxiety. The thing is that the feelings I've had which I always mistook for depression are feelings of despair at the way I can't seem to do things like other people do, that I have dreams and stuff but can't seem to get going on anything even when it's something I like, that I always self sabotage, that I genuinely forget things which are really important to me and feel like a horrible friend/person. The thing is in my case, these are proportionate reactions to situations which happened because of my ADHD, which I couldn't control. It wasn't that I felt like a useless person or a bad friend out of nowhere. I had evidence for these beliefs and they were (somewhat) rational.It is of note that since I have been taking this seriously and been diagnosed I have not lapsed into depression. For a really long time actually. I think it's because I can now put things into context and understand why they happen. I do still have days where I feel totally lost and like I'll never be able to do anything but then I think about what I've achieved with the problems I have and I remember that it's not so bad. I don't get stuck in it like I used to.They say that after diagnosis/discovery there is a period like grief with all of the different stages - anger, denial, depression, etc. And going through that stage of thinking of all the things you have missed out on is a hard one. I felt like writing to my college tutors to explain in case it helped them with a future student, but I decided not to in the end (not now, anyway). Being a part of the ADHD ""community"" has actually helped me to see things in a different way and a lot of the time I actually feel better about it now."
Wriggler79,Tue 23-Aug-16 06:49:07,"Hi, ok if I join? I'm 36, got diagnosed at age 32 after battling past a GP who told me I was depressed, and a psychologist who thought I might have ASD despite me waving Delivered From Distraction at her. Diagnosed at Wakefield, put on Equasym and now gradually improving my life. Had to go to CBT for confidence and self esteem which worked far better than I expected. Left my EA husband and now trying to get a better career. Learned to drive before meds; meds help so much! I struggle with social stuff; not good at remembering birthdays etc, have a general downer on myself and think I witter on and am boring (I do the 'life story' thing!). Have had a look through this thread and downloaded a timer as have some paperwork to do urgently today!"
NotJanine,Wed 08-Feb-17 13:13:21,"I think your first action should be to get an emergency appointment with your gp and tell them that you have had suicidal thoughts and are self-harming. If you find it hard to talk to them, just show them your post above.If you do then want to find someone privately, you could ask at your gp surgery or just look online?"
6catsandcounting,Wed 08-Feb-17 19:08:14,I have had both nhs and private (priory). TBH I am currently finding nhs better for the crisis stuff I need but then it is also postcode lottery and some places I have got nothing. Priory are good for less critical care but I would second the person that says go to your gp and be honest about the self harm and suicidality to get an NHS diagnosis. The bit about not being bpd (assume you mean borderline) because you are 'too succesful' is nonsense btw; I am diagnosed borderline and am 'succesful' too. The misconceptions of borderline are slowly changing but it is taking time. DBT (not sure if available privately) is supposed to be good for bpd as is mindfulness which the Priory did well.
Polkadotties,Mon 06-Feb-17 15:40:17,"I'm ok. I didn't even know I had depression. I thought I had iron issues and fatigue and my NHS GP wasn't interested. For years I've been going to the doctors and saying a feel exhausted, I exist rather than living etc. I had enough and booked a private GP appointment and the lovely GP actually listened to talk and cry for 45 minutes about how rubbish I felt and that I couldn't carry on living this half life anymore. I have PCOS and she said it's linked to that, hence the low carb diet. I'm on 20mg taken at night. I'm still shattered and lacking motivation but it is early days I suppose. I genuinely didn't think I was depressed. I guess I had a stereotypical idea of depression in my head and I didn't 'fit' that. I have a review with my private GP tomorrow"
dangermouseisace,Tue 07-Feb-17 18:52:17,"I agree about the lack of activism.I've previously been politically active (as in organising stuff)…but when I'm unwell I can't do it. Also, there is the worry about future employers seeing you- stigma is very real. It is a worry.NHS person quoted is bullshitting. Suicide is under reported if anything- coroners have to be completely sure the person meant to take their life. As for it decreasing in MH inpatient units- is that simply because there are less beds and suicidal people aren't put in them?"
Apanicaday,Thu 27-Oct-16 17:05:48," Does anyone else find that they can be relatively OK for a time and then wham, out of nowhere it comes on full pelt? I've been on a fairly even keel for a while - the worries come but I can bat them away, and now, all of a sudden it's back. (Heart attack and cervical cancer at the moment). It's not the first time it's happened like this , and it scares me how quickly I fall over the cliff into proper HA mode. At the moment it's because I'm spotting a few days before my period starts. I've always had spotting on and off before AF - although not every month, but suddenly it's going to kill me. I'm so sick of it - it's ruled my life for the last 20 odd years. And at the moment I don't think I'm ever going to control it - I've had cbt, every medication under the sun, and am currently trying ACT, but it's getting to the point where I'm despairing being better - and how do I get better if I don't think I can? And no one knows what to say to me - I find my HA so embarrassing to talk about - hypochondria is such a shitty term abd im concerned that peiple think of me as being neurotic or attention seeking - and I find it hard to talk about because of it. I feel like HA is a bit of a cinderella of mental health issues "
AnxiousCarer,Tue 07-Feb-17 16:40:40, It does sound like you could be depressed. Get yourself a GP appointment. Do try to share with DP how you are feeling. My DH has severe MH problems but has been hugely supportive of me since I've been unwell myself. We are working with our CPNs on being able to support each other better. He has found it tough with me being unwell and less able to support him but we both feel better now the support is going both ways.
