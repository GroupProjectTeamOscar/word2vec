6catsandcounting,Wed 08-Feb-17 19:08:14,I have had both nhs and private (priory). TBH I am currently finding nhs better for the crisis stuff I need but then it is also postcode lottery and some places I have got nothing. Priory are good for less critical care but I would second the person that says go to your gp and be honest about the self harm and suicidality to get an NHS diagnosis. The bit about not being bpd (assume you mean borderline) because you are 'too succesful' is nonsense btw; I am diagnosed borderline and am 'succesful' too. The misconceptions of borderline are slowly changing but it is taking time. DBT (not sure if available privately) is supposed to be good for bpd as is mindfulness which the Priory did well.,,
Alexandra1988,Thu 23-Feb-17 11:29:33,"I've never contributed to mumsnet before but running out of options for help! I have a 'mild' scoliosis 16degree cobb angle diagnosed at 16, apparently didn't progress so no action taken. I went about my twenties not thinking about it at all, dressing how I liked with no one ever commenting on the appearance of my back. Recently (well the last year) I've been suffering with a variety of rubbish-not sure if I'm depressed, anxious, got medical health anxiety or what. Anyway at present I am utterly obsessed with the appearance of my back. I'm sure it has got more pronounced and like a clever girl I set about taking lots of photos and videos of my back in a variety of positions. Cue utter horror to see what I view as a large hump on my right side. My DH when I pointed this out to him said he had never noticed and there was nothing wrong with me. Informed him I actually had scoliosis so there was- he told me I looked fine. Unfortunately I have spent the last month continuing to video, photograph etc and some days I think it looks ok, some days it looks positively deformed. I suppose the point of my post is to see if anyone else has a) scoliosis or b) similar varying views on how they look. Im not getting a lot of sympathy ('I'm sick of you crying about your bloody back when there's nothing wrong with it') and there's no one who understands that silly as it might seem, it is real to me. TIA for any help x",,
Allatseainthemidlands,Tue 04-Oct-16 13:50:53,"I know nothing about mental health but if you need a reason to get out of bed and wash/ make yourself employable have you considered volunteering? You can do all sorts of amazing stuff as a volunteer and meet new people/make new friends in the process. Does your OH feel the same way about your marriage? Could it be retrieved? Is it worth talking about or seeking counselling? And as for your children- this is just a stage- they will get past it - maybe not for several years but they will. They will need you to help them negotiate the early adult years- uni, parenthood etc. It's easy to make your world all about them but you had a world before they came along and you are a whole person whether or not they think so. Please don't despair- and do consider seeing your GP about your sense of sadness and loss. Good luck",,
Alsoflamingo,Mon 08-Dec-14 11:49:09,"What a brilliant, positive take on this time of year, NoLonger. I like it! Will try to keep that in mind as I embark on a week of non-stop parties. Hope I encounter a good selection of non-alcoholic options as they are generally pretty dull (if offered at all). I am coming up for 3 years sober and agree with Alfie about the hardest bit being feeling self-conscious about ordering a soft drink - rather than not drinking - if that makes sense. I plan on allowing myself to indulge my excessive side on chocolate so I don't feel deprived. Although as time goes on I don't really feel deprived - deprived of what? Rotten hangovers, shame, puffy face, red eyes etc‰Û_.Good luck to everyone approaching a sober Christmas. For anyone in London, there are all day AA meetings which you can drop into whenever if you are feeling shaky 'on the day'. I found that really helpful my first year (pretended I was dropping a present round with a God-child and escaped for an hour).",,
Anaffaquine123,Wed 15-Feb-17 22:55:17,"This will be deliberately vague so no-one can be identified but hopeful will still be understandable.Family member ""A"" has for years not taken care of themselves in anyway, personal hygiene, wearing dead relatives clothes, doesn't bother getting painful sores on legs treated, finances in a mess, house an absolute tip etc. Many ""interventions"" have been staged by various family members over the years and A gets help to get things sorted a bit but before long everything is back how it was. A was the victim in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic, kids went to live elsewhere as A couldn't seem to get things sorted. A's personality is completely different to how they were a long time ago. I think the person they used to be is completely lost. The person left doesn't have much emotion about anything and is unbelievably submissive.I have for a very long time felt they were severely depressed. A is only now admitting they need help and has asked me to go to the gp with them tomorrow. A admitted they considered killing themselves today but due to another close family member being pregnant, in their words, ""won't do it yet""It is really difficult to get a dr's appointment at their surgery but I feel it must be tomorrow.

AnnieAnoniMouse,Sun 29-Jan-17 14:08:10,"((((HUG))))You have been through so much. So, so much _ÙÕêYour GP/MHS both sound utterly rubbish, I'm so sorry about that too, because they shouldn't be rubbish, they're too important! If I were you I'd ring the GP's tomorrow from 7:45, constantly, until you get through. Tell them it's an EMERGENCY/URGENT, then if they still don't give you an appointment, tell them you are suicidal so they'd better find you an appointment straight away.Can you speak to the Christian Charity & tell them how you're feeling? That you need more support & more counselling?Are you eating? Drinking plenty of water? Getting some fresh air - even if it's only opening the windows for a bit.It's not surprising the stres has been building up my lovely. Your Dad died, your Mum has cancer, your marriage broke up, you've ended a relationship, you have a child to look after and you have anxiety & depession..FFS show me someone who wouldn't be in a tight old state xYour ex boyfriend needs to stay an ex. You can't work through the cheating & his reaction right now. That aside, the biggest thing here is that you cannot be with someone whose mental health you need to be worried about. You barely have enough resources for yourself.Your DD would not be better off with her Dad, you're her Mum, she loves you, she needs you. Hold her, hug her, just be together when you can, doing nice things - even just colouring or watching TV. It doesn't have to cost money or be energetic. After my Dad died I started getting panic attacks - it was scary. I had to MAKE myself open the front door and breath. I had to force myself to go out of the house and do something, even if it was only go into the village & have a coffee, or I knew I'd just keep getting worse, I didn't want to leave the house at all. I lived alone, my Mum lived overseas & I knew she needed me. I had to be OK for her. It was a fucking awful time in my life and several years on I'm still not who I was before he died (suddenly) & never will be. I didn't have half of what you have had to cope with on top of that. There are a lot of us knittIng & crocheting for the Woolly Hugs. It's a nice part of MN to be in, lots of lovely people who are very welcoming. It doesn't matter if you can't already knit or crochet, we can teach you and if you can't afford to buy the right wool, we can send you some _Ù÷_ You're not alone _ÙÕê",,
AnxiousCarer,Tue 21-Feb-17 17:43:09," Hi, it sounds like things are tough at the moment. I know how stressful I find it when DH has been out of work and We've been in the same sort of financial situation as you. As everything is feeling hard I wonder if a trip to the GP is in order. You could be depressed as a culmination of all the stress. Do you do anything judt for you? I find that really important for my MH. I find exercise and meditation and mindfulness helpful. I always seem to have a better day when I meditate before work for 10 mins. I used an app called headspace initially which was useful. I tend to do it on the bus on the way to work.",,
AnxiousCarer,Mon 13-Feb-17 17:23:02,"Speaking from experience put yourself and your (and babys) health first. If you go under then you can't support anyone else, and right now you need to be getting in the best place mentally yourself for when baby arrives.Definately share with DP. DH and I both have mental health problems and have learnt the hard way that trying to protect each other by keeping them to our selves generally backfires spectacularly!Your DM is obviously having a really hard time at the moment, but she is an adult and she needs to be the one going back to her GP and discussing how she is feeling, including the suicidal feelings. Make sure she has the samaritans number, and knows that she can go to A&E or contact crisis team, if she feels she needs to. I also think you need to set some boundries with her. Explain kindly that you are struggling yourself and can't offer her the support you would like to at the moment. Maybe set days and times when you will or wont be available. I know when my DM was going through a hard time a few years ago I wouldn't always answer the phone, if I didn't feel up to it.",,
AnxiousCarer,Tue 07-Feb-17 16:40:40, It does sound like you could be depressed. Get yourself a GP appointment. Do try to share with DP how you are feeling. My DH has severe MH problems but has been hugely supportive of me since I've been unwell myself. We are working with our CPNs on being able to support each other better. He has found it tough with me being unwell and less able to support him but we both feel better now the support is going both ways.,,
AnxiousCarer,Tue 24-Jan-17 18:08:23," Definately good idea to see GP again, you do sound depressed and it might well be worth giving the ADs a go again. Ive been on them 3 times in the last 15 years and they have helped me get through some tough times. I've found going on them when I first notice I am struggling has ment I've never got as low as the first time. If you feel upto it have another go at booking the talking therapy too as that can be really helpful.",,
AnxiousMunchkin,Sat 27-Feb-16 09:40:25,I'll keep talking to myself. I did a test last night and this morning and both negative. But still no AF. 9 days late now. If this is a side effect of sertraline I'm really worried because I can't be coping with this worry that I might be pregnant every month. But sertraline was the last antidepressant that I was happy to try. Although I'm actually taking it for anxiety. But I will not take paroxetine or fluoxetine again as I became suicidal on them. Citalopram was not effective for me. Venlafaxine worked well I thought but then I overdosed on it and it caused a seizure so I think that's out again now. Sertraline is the only one that the GP offered me that I was happy to try. I expected some side effects but affecting my cycles like this is too much of a worry that its counterproductive if the whole point is to help manage my anxiety. It's so frustrating.,,
AnxiousMunchkin,Sat 27-Feb-16 10:49:21,"Oh goodness. Hello. I feel a bit embarrassed now like I've been discovered mumbling to myself in a darkened room The plan is to go up to 100mg but my GP wanted to start very low and ease up because of my previous experience of suicidal ideation on some other SSRIs. I realise that GAD would be a diagnosis but I'm not sure if that's my diagnosis IYSWIM. She tends to say ""if"". I'm trying to commit myself to the plan of staying on this for at least a few months at the proper dose to give it a proper try. But I'm worried because I really don't need any other things to fuel anxiety I'm perfectly capable of finding millions of things to worry and obsess about without adding to it! It's confusing though I can't find amennorrhoea listed as a side effect of sertraline. But my cycles have never been disrupted before and I've been going through stress and anxiety for some time. I am worried about developing suicidal thoughts again. I don't have any at the moment. But I have started to think about self harm and that's not something I've done for probably a decade. Just the idea of causing some physical pain as a focus, something real to concentrate on.",,
AnxiousMunchkin,Sun 29-Jan-17 11:35:53,"Things that work for me a short, mindful activities - things that don't take too long to complete (so I get the reward of finishing it) and that I have to think about whilst I'm doing it (so my mind can't wander onto all the crap it wants to torture me with). Things for me in that category are adult colouring books, building Lego models (actually find this very soothing!), mini craft project - I have a sewing kit for making felt tree decorations and each one takes 30-45 mins, hopefully by next xmas I'll have the full set done!. Baking or cooking something works for me too, planning it, preparing the ingredients, putting it together. Tackling a mini home project - declutter one drawer, clean out one kitchen cupboard, reorganise one category of books/DVDs etc. I know for some people that would not be relaxing at all but for me it really is! (Can I joke <OCD alert> now that I am diagnosed with it?)Things that I find harder when I am most depressed are things like watching films/tv - I lose track and then mind wanders. Taking a bath - mind wanders - although I have found listening to a 30min podcast or radio play/drama episode has been a good thing to do in the bath to remedy this. For me yoga is a big part of my mental health self-care, I go to classes several times a week and practice at home most days too. There's tonnes of videos for free on YouTube. Definitely a mindful activity. Finally, 'pure' mindfulness meditation (learning via the headspace app) has definitely, definitely helped me a lot, BUT it didn't at first, I had to be a bit better in the first place to find it useful. For me, that's where medication came in. Have you looked into various nutritional supplements etc touted as having mental health benefits - perhaps would be less intimidating than medication?",,
Apanicaday,Thu 27-Oct-16 17:05:48," Does anyone else find that they can be relatively OK for a time and then wham, out of nowhere it comes on full pelt? I've been on a fairly even keel for a while - the worries come but I can bat them away, and now, all of a sudden it's back. (Heart attack and cervical cancer at the moment). It's not the first time it's happened like this , and it scares me how quickly I fall over the cliff into proper HA mode. At the moment it's because I'm spotting a few days before my period starts. I've always had spotting on and off before AF - although not every month, but suddenly it's going to kill me. I'm so sick of it - it's ruled my life for the last 20 odd years. And at the moment I don't think I'm ever going to control it - I've had cbt, every medication under the sun, and am currently trying ACT, but it's getting to the point where I'm despairing being better - and how do I get better if I don't think I can? And no one knows what to say to me - I find my HA so embarrassing to talk about - hypochondria is such a shitty term abd im concerned that peiple think of me as being neurotic or attention seeking - and I find it hard to talk about because of it. I feel like HA is a bit of a cinderella of mental health issues ",,

I don't blame her for the way I felt but it certainly didn't help. She will not, or cannot, take responsibility for her addiction. It is my dad's fault she drinks because he cheated on her 20 years ago, or its my fault because I was depressed, or my sisters fault because she was out celebrating the end of her exams with her friends, or because her mum died just after I was born.

Babblehag,Wed 05-Oct-16 09:32:17,"Op i really feel you need to see the doctor, get some antidepressants, explain how citralopram made you feel and they'll prescribe something different, they'll lift the fog a tiny bit at a time until you feel a bit better, they can really help, depression really is a horrible illness, you say its a catastrophy of events that have made you low, that's how depression starts in some people, other people just get it randomly, it doesn't follow a specific type of person. I agree with the pp, find a hobby, don't worry about a job just yet, It'll only add to your stress. Find a hobby that gets you out of the house, a knitting club or exersise class are usually good ones. That way you'll make new friends too. Make your task today to ring the doctor, just tell the receptionist you feel its depression, the doc will want to see you quickly, if you cant face getting out today, make the appointment for tomorrow, that's your challenge tomorrow, get up, get dressed, go docs, done. I suffer badly too, and recently been given meds, I don't even think I spoke to my doctor, I just cried, I may have mumbled prozac.

BabooshkaBabooshka,Thu 13-Jun-13 08:50:21,"Shakey1500, my kids are young (5 and 2) and I have a little bit of support from my husband and mother (most of the grandparents live abroad). However, the support is mostly physical but they are also the ones who made me have another child, knowing how mentally ill I was so I don't really feel very supported by them. In all honesty, I don't think they really have a clue how I feel, even though I have spoken about it so much. I am just so so angry with myself, I can't get over it. I go over and over it in my mind and am just so constantly angry and the worst part is that I feel like these relatives don't really care about me that much because at the end of the day they put their desires (for another child/grandchild) before me and my wellbeing. It was obviously more important for my husband to have this child than for me to be well and happy. I have been sacrificed for his wants. It's not even like he is such a great dad and I wonder why we did all this when most of the time he seems so bored and frustrated with them. Recently the constant noise (high pitched screaming at 6am and constant fighting) has started to really get to me and I am starting to get very irritated by it and have started wearing earplugs all the time (which are not very comfortable).I just don't know what to do.

He is 15 months old now, and while I'd go to the ends of the Earth for him, there is not a day goes by that I don't kick myself. It is not PND. I am not depressed or 'down'. No doubt someone will try to convince me it is, just like unhappy victorian ladies were labelled as mentally ill when they were desperately unhappy with the lives society gave them. I am perfectly happy with my life, or rather, I was. My son is perfectly lovely, and my dh is extremely helpfull. I adore them both. And no, I wasn't pressured into it, either. I was in love with the idea. I thought it was what I wanted. Society told me it was what I wanted ,right?I would never give up my ds, and I look forward to giving him a loving environment to grow and learn... but if there was a way to reverse time, and politely, painlessly engineer him out of existence, I would. Honestly.It never occurred to me that I had any choice otherwise. Nobody ever tells you that you have a choice. I miss my old life intensely, and the thought that I had every right and opportunity to keep it that way makes me sick. It's got to the point that these thoughts don't make me feel guilty anymore.I miss my relationship with my partner. I miss what we did together. I miss being able to walk out the front door of my own bloody house without a second thought. I miss having the money to spend on the odd nice thing. I miss having a house full of our nice, beautiful, adult things. I miss being able to ponder freely over my career options. Honestly, truthfully, does anyone feel the same? I don't mean those who are unfortunate enough to have depression... does anyone actually endure cold, hard regret? Even just sometimes? I don't want help. I don't even know what I want. I don't think I could describe myself as feeling ""desperate"". I guess i just want to feel like I'm not a hideous monster all on my own.I know I'll probably get a million identical replies of ""It's sometimes hard... but I wouldn't change them for the world!!!"".

BertieBotts,Sun 24-Jul-16 20:04:29,"Interestingly the doctor who diagnosed me said she very much wanted to get me to do an intelligence test because she was very interested to see what it would say (she thinks I have very high intelligence) but the clinic didn't have the licence to one in English.I have never done a proper IQ test but I did once out of interest do an online sample quiz to join a MENSA organisation and got 98%.OMG, I could have written your post 3 years ago when I first found out about ADHD. Interestingly, though I had always thought of myself as prone to depression/suffering from depression multiple times since I was 14 (in hindsight, this was just when my ADHD started to seriously affect my life because it was when I first had to start being responsible for myself.) When I started psychotherapy/CBT my therapist asked me some questions about my depression and actually I don't, and have never, fitted the DSM criteria for it. That astounded me. Similarly for anxiety. The thing is that the feelings I've had which I always mistook for depression are feelings of despair at the way I can't seem to do things like other people do, that I have dreams and stuff but can't seem to get going on anything even when it's something I like, that I always self sabotage, that I genuinely forget things which are really important to me and feel like a horrible friend/person. The thing is in my case, these are proportionate reactions to situations which happened because of my ADHD, which I couldn't control. It wasn't that I felt like a useless person or a bad friend out of nowhere. I had evidence for these beliefs and they were (somewhat) rational.It is of note that since I have been taking this seriously and been diagnosed I have not lapsed into depression. For a really long time actually. I think it's because I can now put things into context and understand why they happen. I do still have days where I feel totally lost and like I'll never be able to do anything but then I think about what I've achieved with the problems I have and I remember that it's not so bad. I don't get stuck in it like I used to.They say that after diagnosis/discovery there is a period like grief with all of the different stages - anger, denial, depression, etc. And going through that stage of thinking of all the things you have missed out on is a hard one. I felt like writing to my college tutors to explain in case it helped them with a future student, but I decided not to in the end (not now, anyway). Being a part of the ADHD ""community"" has actually helped me to see things in a different way and a lot of the time I actually feel better about it now.",,

Bollydarling,Wed 14-May-14 00:36:37,"Thanks. I can really relate to a lot of what been said and realise that I am not depressed, just not happy with my current situation.It really is taboo to say anything negative about having children. If I am slightly down with one 'friend' who has spent the deposit for a house on IVF, I am immediately reminded of how lucky I am. Yet I have to keep stum when she says how much she needs her week long yoga retreat in Turkey. I have had a friend reshuffle since having kids. I think for those of you considering kids I would sayIf you are getting on a bit (I was 40 when DS was born and 42 when DD was born) and in any way ambivalent then don't do it. Try and ignore the pressure or deal with it outright, take the steps to ensure you don't stay in a relationship when DP/DH changes his mind about kids, find something else meaningful to fill your time etc. I'm not sure that I regret that I had kids but if I had my time again things would be different. If you do go ahead make sure you have done your maths. Full time child care for one child can be covered by a å£20k salary with a bit to spare. It costs over å£2k a month for two.... And when you have moved to the sticks for a better quality of life, å£35k jobs in the charitable sector are hard to come by. I didn't plan to have kids so didn't plan my career. DH earns enough for us to live on but there's nothing to spare. Two kids also seem to be sooooo much more difficult than one so if you are in any way ambivalent about the second don't do it. Having said that my 9 month old DD is gorgeous with a sunny nature (she didn't get that from me) and seems to be an easier baby than her brother. But I am sure when he is 4 and she is 2 he will be the easier child.Don't have preconceptions about how you will parent or let anyone tell you what to do. Have confidence in your gut instincts. Breast feeding past 6 months, baby wearing, bed sharing etc have helped me bond with children whom I think I love but have no overwhelming feelings for. For other people bottles, schedules and sleep training work as they enable them to return to work and have a break. It is very difficult when grandparents are too old/far away to be actively involved, and the local mums I have bonded with are those that work or who will be going back to work shortly so limited opportunities for helping out with child care to give each other a break. It feels selfish to walk out the door for run as DH walks after a 12 hour day but if it means I have more patience then it isn't selfish. I personally have used baby and toddler groups as a chance for break as sometimes someone will hold the baby and the toddler can play independently, it just depends on how he is feeling. Often someone will make me a cup of coffee as wellGood luck to us all. This thread has made me realise, once again, that things are not so bad for me",,

I have reached out as you have in despair a few times. She always replied promptly. I would feel very hurt in your posistion.

canyoubelieveit,Tue 22-Jan-13 23:28:30,"I have a single mother to a one year old daughter who I had at the age of 35. All my life I thought I wanted children and I loved spending time with my friends children. I am so depressed at being a parent and I have absolutely no reason to be as my daughter is the sweetest, most lovable little girl who deserves the very best. I never thought in a million years I would feel like this honestly feel my life is over and I wish so much I could turn the clock back. I have explored anti depressants and therapy and none of it has helped. Has anyone ever thought things would be better for their child if they were adopted? Not that this could ever happen unless you were a teenage Mother. Having a child is a blessing, and it is so unnatural not to feel the greatest love for your child- I know I received it from my parents myself so I just don't understand how I could have got this so very wrong and I didn't know myself. I know it's utterly disgraceful and for most Mothers unbelievable but I really don't know what to do. Does anyone else feel this bad? I feel so guilty and sorry for my daughter but I desperately wish I could return to my old life. I find the practicalities and responsibilities of parenthood daunting and am like a Bridget Jones messy untidy childlike and it feels really tough rather than feeling you do whatever you can for your child I am not enjoying all the different stages which other parents understandably love. I have lost my confidence at work as I work 3 days a week so am out of the loop and I can't enjoy the days I have with my daughter- can't get things done, can't manage to look in anyway acceptably normal and groomed and be organised, tidy and practical. I'm also not at all interested in peppa pig etc. I honestly feel I am not cut out to look after another human being and it will get more demanding practically and financially as the years go on. I look around at all the Mothers I know and many of them have more children and a much more demanding life but they are motivated by the passion they feel towards their children. I really don't know what I can do to turn my thinking around and I've got to do it for the sake of my daughter. Does anyone have any advice? I just wish there was a way out of parenthood- can you believe it?",,
CherryBlini,Mon 06-Feb-17 10:31:54,"Yes i suffer and I don't know what to do about it really but I'm trying to help myself! My HA started when both my parents were diagnosed with cancer .. so I know the root cause. This leads me to think that therapy won't help - what's the point? I know what's causing it! The 'sane' side of my brain tells me that what I'm thinking is completely mad. I KNOW that the fact I've got a painful back doesn't mean it's some sort of secondary cancer. I absolutely know that. I know that the fact my left breast aches doesn't mean cancer - it probably means hormonal changes as I'm 45 now. I keep telling myself this and I really do know it. It's just a shame the HA keeps popping up all the bloody time. I'm dealing with it by trying to eat well, taking up yoga and reading more. Having a relaxing bath. I'm considering reflexology and I might look into the Headspace app. I won't go to the doctor and waste his/her time because I know I have HA and not a brain tumour - although the brain tumour was last month  I am going to try and beat this without any medication .. I'm not depressed or mad - I've just got this damn HA and I know full well what's brought it on.

CoffeeBreakIn5,Sat 11-Feb-17 19:11:11,"A year ago I made the decision to leave my job, I'd been treated like I just didn't matter at work anymore and it was really affecting my mental health. I'd been prescribed Citalopram at the time but soon realised that I needed to leave that environment so I handed in my notice. As predicted, things got worse during my notice period and I ended up taking sick leave. None of my colleagues contacted me, I wanted to say goodbye so I went into work on a day that a few other people were leaving the company. I asked my boss if this was ok and got the go ahead, I messaged a few people I'd previously been close to at work so they knew. When I got there no one gave a damn, leaving cards and presents were being given out and I received only one from the company and that was given as an after thought. I left that day and vowed to have nothing to do with any of them. I should add that there have never been any grievances aired about me but a colleague had tried to blame me for something whilst I was off but had been sent off by my boss with a flea in his ear due to it having nothing to do with me.A few months later I was added to a message group on Facebook by a group of people I didn't work directly with but who I'd been friendly with over the years (I'd been there 15 years). I was invited to a gathering they were having and I went, I had a nice time and they told me how bad they felt about the way I'd left and how I'd been ignored. I told them it was absolutely fine and that I'd missed them, no hard feelings etc etc and that was that. We've swapped a few messages and would most likely be organising a meet up in the next few weeks.I found out through Facebook that there was a huge leaving party for a colleague last night, one of the people in the message group had posted publicly about how lovely it was to send of this amazing person and how great it was that so many employees, past and present, had been able to attend. I'd heard absolutely nothing about this party, I'd worked with the man the whole time I'd worked there and we were friendly. Loads of ex employees were there. I suffer horrible social anxiety, I'm coming out of a depressed episode and although I don't want to go back to Citalopram I think it's for the best. Because of this I can't tell if my reactions are rational or not - I want to delete them all from Facebook and have nothing more to do with any of them, but is this overreacting? I feel so sad about it, but surely if they've done this then they actually don't care about being friends with me - they'd have invited me if they did? Should I cut them off? Or am I overreacting? They were so lovely to me when I saw them last but now I feel betrayed. What should I do? I feel like doing if I do nothing it's allowing people to treat me badly but if I do something it'd be irrational.Sorry this is long, I'm all mixed up today.",,

Last week, with the support of my dp I finally plucked up the courage to see my GP who was understanding and I have been on 50mg sertraline for 5 days so far. For some reason I had this irrational fear that I would be brushed off or that I was just being dramatic so I kept putting off going to the doctors. Wish I'd gone sooner now.Been having quite a few side effects from the meds such as dry mouth, unsettled sleep, tiredness, loss of appetite, feeling restless/fidgety, feeling 'strange' and more panicky. The GP did say this could happen for the first few weeks but despite the above side effects I do feel like the meds have been helping. I definitely feel less depressed, I haven't had as many negative thoughts, I've felt more motivated about doing stuff around the house and I mostly feel I've been less snappy with dp and the kids although I still have my moments. I know it can take time for them to kick in fully.Fingers crossed once the side effects wear off I continue to make improvements.

I knew it didn't matter how well I acted and that it wasn't my fault that she was so abusive, but it still hurt. I discovered music festivals as a result. I soon began selling my artwork at them, touring all over the country. the farther away from my abusive mother I was, the better I felt. from 15 to 28 years old, it was always the same life-long art goals- to finish new masterpieces and then sell them at the shows. I gained recognition around the country while still a teenager and thought I was on my way... but then I was approached by a guy that seemed to care a lot about me. I was very busy and wasn't even lookn for a boyfriend but I fell for his charms. I was dumb because he turned out to be an abuser. I told him that I didn't want children but he kept pushing me to have unprotected sex. he beat me while I was pregnant. to make along story short, my art dreams have been replaced with single motherhood, and i'm dying inside. no time for the kind of art I do. I used to lock myself in a room for weeks literally. I do love my son and I try to block out the pain of being severed from my livelihood but it always resurfaces again and again. I've always used my art to heal and I'm unable to get my therapy. I feel like instead of being that well known and respected artist, instead i'm on my way to becoming my worst nightmare- my mother. worst part is that I've ended up moving to my mother's home town for more support. unfortunately her alcoholism makes her distant and it's just me and my son on our own now in iowa. iowa a place I never would have saw myself 5 years ago from Colorado where I used to live.

I don't know what I'm doing and I'm in a state of complete despair.I am seven weeks pg, but very ambivalent towards the pg. I know that to have a baby, you should really want one. And I'm not sure how much I do. I am forty and have no other children, so at this point I think I have to accept that I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't. It's going to be difficult either way; with either course of action, there will be hardships and loss and regrets. But this still doesn't help me to know what to do.My situation is complicated by the fact that I am 40; dp is almost 60. But hey! at least I have a dp, right? Lots of people go it alone at this age.... the other factor that doesn't help is that there are no aunts / cousins / grandparents / brothers / sisters, etc in our town, so we'd be dealing with all childcare on our own. My family are miles away. His family are grown / scattered / dead, etc.I love playing with babies and small children, and I have a nephew who I adore. But I've never spent more than 48 hours in sole charge of a tot. THe idea of it fills me equally with feelings of excitement and horror. Now that I am pg, I constantly try to imagine myself doing the things I normally do, only while being in sole charge of a two-year-old. This rules out: taking a long bath; going running; lying here on Sunday morning typing this; browsing shops; taking a long time to cook something new; staying late at work because I feel like getting a bit extra done; basically, the extent to which it changes your life makes my head spin. It is intimidating me. How do you all manage?!I keep thinking to myself: you are 40. You've managed this far, without children. You haven't particularly craved them. You are doing okay now (after many and various difficulties, especially in my 20s). But then I think: if you terminate, you will regret it because this is your last chance.Although my desire to have kids has always been ""Oh, it'll be nice if it happens"", rather than ""Got To Do It At All Costs!!"". Now it is happening and if I'm completely honest, I can't say I'm over the moon. My initial reaction when I saw the faint line was, ""Oh. S**t.""  I thought, ""perhaps I'll miscarry, then the decision will take care of itself"", but I don't think this is going to happen, somehow. I'm an idiot and I don't know what to do. I have printed this entire thread and read it lots of times. The bits that resonate are MelaniefhappyAND work!

BUT - I still feel it would have been better for all concerned if he had never existed.Of course, it's highly unfortunate to look back, with hindsight, and think ""if I could live again, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have children"". And I would like to avoid this, of course. But then you have mothers saying ""it was the making of me"", ""the most intense love affair ever"", ""the best thing I ever did"". But I have no clue which way it will go for me. All I know is that I am full of trepidation.

But I don't feel at all jealous of older mums in their fifties struggling with hormonal teenagers, and knackered sixty-year-olds working difficult jobs to put demanding kids through university. And the baby bit is oh-so-transient. Perhaps I should focus on being a brilliant auntie to my three neices and nephews, and a good partner and loving daughter to my brilliant mum (who I haven't always had the best relationship with, but I do now).I'm scared of the commitment, and scared of living out the rest of my years feeling as though I've missed something wonderful and as though I lack a sense of purpose. Plus, I would always be looking over my shoulder at that time when I was 40, thinking ""what if...?"". To be honest, though, I don't think an abortion would ruin my life. I had one at 35 and didn't regret it or think about it much. In the back of my mind I was thinking ""there can be another time"". But this time, there can't. I need to take control, make a decision, and enjoy the rest of my life. Yet this is easier said than done. In some ways, getting pg at 40 is like a gift. I have had not a jot of sickness. So why am I so unsure what to do for the best.Then there is the small matter of money: neither me nor dp have much money. He is retired and has a pension of å£1,000 a month. I'd be on maternity. Not much to sustain three of us! I should have known my own mind before getting pg. There is a counselling service for women in our position called 'ticktockcounselling' but I didn't know until I was pg. I agree with all of you who cite social pressures: threads like this are like 24 carot gold. Elsewhere, all you hear about are the supposed delights and joys.What a mess. ",,
GinAndSonic,Sat 18-Feb-17 21:35:08,"I beleive you. Im so sorry you didn't get the outcome you wanted and that things are so tough for you right now. I never reported my rapes, but I did have rape counselling and it was so helpful. I was referred to them by a domestic violence worker, could one of the professionals you are involved with do the referal rather than you having to self refer? It probably won't speed it up but it takes the pressure off of you needing to make the call. My local rape crisis centre has helpline evenings where you can call to just talk or you can email a dedicated address to just talk, it's not counselling but it's a volunteer listening service. Alternatively maybe samaritans? They have an email service too that I used when supporting a suicidal friend. ",,
goneloopy,Sun 12-Feb-17 11:24:38,"Brief history - SAHM, 2DC, DH, been on AD on and off for years. Currently on sertraline 100mg. Been doing ok on it, but recently started feeling very low again, tired all the time, isolating myself from family and friends, don't even want to leave the house. Don't know why I'm posting really, just wanted to get it out so to speak. Should I go back to my GP? Just want to shake this feeling of apathy and tiredness. I don't want my DC to have such a bad mother who doesn't want to take them places, who has no motivation to leave the house. I am drifting further and further away from my DH too. We barely speak, just co exist. I'm just tired of it all. I'm not suicidal as I'd never do that to my DC but I can see how easy it would be for that to happen. ",,
gratesnakes,Sun 09-Oct-16 22:15:29,"Hello OP, please go to a GP. Print out some of your posts here for them to read if you think you will struggle to explain yourself. Tell them that you would like to try different meda and different therapy this time. You sound really depressed but you can get better I am sure. My sister was a professional type but struggled to find work in recent years due to depression. Anti depressants have really worked for her so there really is hope. She did not want to go back into a competitive workplace and she now works part time as a carer for old people and she finds it very satisfying.You are probably much too young to be menopausal but if you have any reason to suspect that you are you could also mention that to the GP.",,
HavingAMaybe,Sun 07-Oct-12 01:42:39,"Have been following this thread for some time, and I am so grateful for everyone's honesty.I do not have children. Never thought I would. I am married to someone who never considered that he might not have kids one day. We discussed this at length both before and after getting married (and continue to now) but my feeling is that deep down he thinks I will change my mind.Occasionally I do think that maybe we should - he would be fabulous as a father and he understands most of my reasons for not wanting to.I had a mother who was depressed, unhappy, bitter etc. She has narc tendencies. My father just kept out of it for the most part and had many affairs. Eventually they split but not until I was in my late teens. I have anxiety and depressive episodes. I just know that having a child would be mentally extremely tough for me, despite DH knowing this. I don't think he really understands what it would be like and my fears about this.My friends who have (willingly! more or less) had children have been relatively honest with me as they know how I feel. They have had struggles and depression etc - almost all of them. And for the most part they weren't already dealing with mental health histories.I fear for my marriage ultimately. I love him, but I am not capable of being so selfless as to put myself through it all for him. I almost look forward to getting a bit older and finding that I am no longer able to have kids. Or I sometimes think that it may be a relief to find out that I can't. Which makes me feel like a very bad person obviously as there are people who would dearly love to be able to and can't. Anyway, that's me. Am very grateful for this thread.",,
HoneyBadger80,Wed 28-May-14 20:27:56,"Its funny how you never love your children so much as when they are sleeping! I mean I love my DS, don't get me wrong, I have always loved him in a dutiful functional kind of way, but I have never enjoyed being a parent until recently, and even now occasionally its really tiresome... Known affectionately to me (or not) as 'being under house arrest', it was horrid being a SAHM- just mind numbingly boring and endlessly tiring, like an 18hr job with no pay and no one to talk to, then in the other 6 hours you get to do further housework etc and maybe squeeze a bit of a snooze in here and there.When you're a single mom, you might as well be in solitary confinement, but its even worse because you add total sleep deprivation, slave labor and mental torture that you cant share with a significant other...it comes to something when you have seen all the episodes of peppa pig (my favorite being the one where they go ice skating) and the thing you look forward to is an episode you haven't seen, and that you have managed to learn basic sign language courtesy of Mr Tumble.I was never maternal, people even used to comment how odd it looked if i held a friends baby (normally at arms length hoping it wouldn't puke), i have no idea why I decided to have a baby- it seemed like the right time I suppose, financially stable, engaged (although he left not long after DS was born) blah blah blah. Turns out I'm a crap mom, not in the basic needs sense, but in the actually liking children sense. I mean if it were Neanderthal times then I'd be the most awesome mom ever- like if it were about survival of the fittest then my offspring would be chubby feral survivors.... but its not. Its a day and age where even the mere sniff of not being totally grateful and in love with motherhood gets you shot down by the mummy mafia. Those who chirp on about how fulfilling and meaningful having children is and who do arts and crafts 8 hours a day, and bake cakes with perfect princess daughters like something off a bloody flora advert.I had post natal depression, which sucked, I dont think i really loved DS with affection until he was about 6 months old thanks to that, but i was a good mom in the functional sense (keeping things clean, keeping DS fed and watered, changed and comfortable and happily dribbling at the tweenies) for the first 18 months, it didn't get really bad until the 'terrible 2,3 and 4's kicked in, along with speech, potty training, breaking things, tantrums and the words 'no' and 'why'. In hindsight i think i got off pretty easy as my DS was a pretty good child looking back and having experience now of other peoples kids who are far more 'naughty' than my DS was, or friends with kids who have disabilities requiring constant care... but at the time, being an exhausted single mom with no support network and no outside contact from grown ups other than my parents or family maybe once or twice a week, i used to think about walking out all the time and leaving DS with his dad or with my parents....I mean men just take off all the time without much recrimination, so why couldn't I?NO IDEA...god i wanted to....I wanted to SO badly. I used to fantasize about running away and working in bars in greece or on cruise ships etc all the time, but there was just something that stopped me, I don't know if it was some deeper primal in-build mother love/instinct or just plain society based expectation and guilt. I used to get to the point of packing my bags then I'd have a flash forward into how much I could screw him up emotionally. See his little face understanding that his mom didn't love him. To think I hadn't loved him enough to stay, to think he wasn't worth the effort, to think he could live his life feeling like he wasn't worthy and where those feeling of self loathing/guilt/worthlessness might take him. The kind of life he could end up living if I weren't there to keep fighting for better for him(cue tears and floods of guilt). Bloody awful times they were. It was just a cycle of misery- frustration- resentment and guilt.It started getting easier when he turned about 5 and started to understand the world a bit better, and being more independent....I think it also helped that I started working full time about the same time. He's 8 now, and I can say now that he's brilliant 90% of the time- he's my little mate and has a great personality and I love him to bits, I miss him now a little bit when he goes to his dads or grandparents, which is a relatively new experience as I've always enjoyed and craved my child-free time and as long as his safety was assured I'd go and have a 'single and childfree' 48 hours once every 2 weeks- where I could pretend I had my life as it was pre-DS and go back to real life on a sunday evening.Having been just me and him for so long now, I cant imagine my life without him (wait that's not true- I imagine my life without him fondly and wistfully for 5 seconds, then realize there's only so much clubbing in Day-Glo bikinis a woman can do at the age of 34 LOL). Its a pain in the bum all the rushing about and organizing and planning that you do when you are trying to 'enrich' your child's life, all the driving to cubs/football/cricket/parties/swimming lessons/karate/play dates...god it just goes on and on and never ends, kind of like the laundry pile created by afore mentioned extra curricular activities. I am convinced I could personally captain an elite squad of Navy seals with my military timing and planning precision.When i look back i feel massively ashamed and guilty about all the times i resented him and the life i chose in having him, yes it was hard, yes it was tiring and thankless and exhausting and at times soul destroying. Yes I felt like I had lost who I was, and that the only thing that defined me was being a mom, that I had given up my life for 18 years. But truth be told I was selfish and immature and not particularly nice before I had him- I realize that now. He has taught me to be truly selfless, to make sacrifices when I REALLY don't want to, to think always of someone else's future beyond my own and having him has in general made me a more patient, organized and independent person than I would ever have thought possible. I still wear my 'bad mom' t-shirt every now and again (metaphoric of course) and scream and shout at him over small things that needn't be screamed about...and he knows to give me a wide berth on those days... but when I see the kind, sensitive, helpful, mostly polite and thoughtful boy that he is becoming already, I have hope that despite everything, despite all the negative thoughts and misery and despair i felt in the early years, and all the crying in the shower, and all the wishing I'd never had him, that he is, against the odds, going to turn out to be a lovely young man....and it absolves me a little of the guilt. That if our children are reflections of us as parents, I cant be such a truly awful terrible incapable mother. TBF I think I got away really lightly with him- cos he's more of a moaner than a rebel, and aside from ongoing (grrr) annoying nightly negotiations about why he has to go to bed at 8.30, he's pretty low maintenance.I never thought i'd find myself saying i wouldn't change having him...up until the last couple of years i was still saying i regretted ever having kids...in fact i could have been voted the person most likely to build a time machine and go back and change everything so I could carry on clubbing in furry boots and run away with the circus... but now the hardest times have passed, I wouldn't change him. ....still there's the 10% of the time when I cant wait for him to grow up and sod off lol.Hugs to everyone feeling crappy...all I can say is hopefully it will get easier for you like it has for me. And don't feel guilty if you aren't mary poppins- the mummy mafia will manage with one less member. xxxxxx",,
HowTheFuckDoIDoThis,Wed 01-Feb-17 16:33:05,"I asked the doctor this on my last visit, during depression. She said if i was bipolar i would be climbing the walls. I knew that was a load of rubbish, but just accepted what she said. I know my doctors notes did say 'manic depression' years ago. Which is bipolar. I dont think it says that now. I think it says dysthymia. I am back at the docs on friday so will ask again about it. I was there a few weeks back and was put onto sertraline. I thought it was working. I felt great, full of energy. I was ready for anything that came my way. My house was immaculate. Then i went on a spending spree on a ridiculous amount of shoes, storage boxes, ottomans. I was in the mindset of it being time to get everything sorted once and for all. After a week or so, i thought i was still depressed. I thought the spending sprees were associated with depression. I went back to docs explaining what happened and asked to increase my meds. Since then, i have gone 'flat'. Physically i feel depressed, but mentally i dont. It is frustrating as i want to do housework and other things, but physically i havent got the motivation. I now wonder if i went somewhat hypo/manic when taking anti depressants. I also wonder if i associated my spending sprees with depression as i crash after it and lack motivation. You kind of just forget all of those times you feel great and focus more so on the downers. Which is always when i go to the doctors. There have been a number of times i have felt as great as i mentioned earlier.",,
HowTheFuckDoIDoThis,Wed 01-Feb-17 18:38:56,"I have been on and off meds for years. Ive had all of the ssri's. They tried me with an snri(mirtazapine) and (looking back) again, i went weird. I was very suicidal, but very agitated and on edge. I rang the doctor a few times worried about myself, i also spoke with the samaritans and emailed them - so not my usual depression of shutting myself down and away. I stopped them myself as the doctor wouldnt listen and told me to keep going with them. Went off trqck a bit there! Im now back on an ssri, sertraline. I have had these episodes a lot of times throughout my life. There is a high chance the ssri's have affected me previously in the same way. My last (what i think) hypomanic episode, i decided to start making my own natural products. I bought bars of beeswax, shea butter, coconut oil and god knows what else. I have a cupboard full of natural shit. I made body butters, hair products and stuff that i dont actually use! I gave the kids some to give their teachers because i thought it was great! The shame _Ù÷Ó lolAnyway, i wasnt on any meds then. I will mention how it is having an impact on my life and hopefully i will get referred",,
HowTheFuckDoIDoThis,Fri 03-Feb-17 11:01:05,"Thank you all. I have been to the docs this morning. I seen the same doctor who said previously that its not bipolar as id be climbing the walls. I explained things in more detail, especially about since starting sertraline. She said i have already been referred to a psychiatrist. When i went to the doctors to get my meds increased i had told him about how i felt after starting the sertraline. He asked if i wanted talking therapy and i said i dont know. He said he will send them a message anyway. I didnt understand as its self referral, the doc just gives you a number to ring. So he obviously referred me to psychiatry instead, without me even knowing. He wqs a different doctor to the one i seen today. Today she listened to me and seemed to agree. I suppose the difference in my mood was quite clear to her as well. Last time i seen her i was depressed, very anxious and not very talkative. Today, i felt confident, great and very talkative. So now she wants another appointment with me as the 10 minutes wasnt enough for her. She wants to get more information to make a better report to psychiatry as previous doctor hasnt said much in his referral. She had typed up about hypomanic - whether she was saying that i currently am hypomanic, or saying that ive mentioned of times i feel ive been hypomanic, i dont know. She advised me to continue taking my sertraline as she doesnt want me to just stop it. She said we will discuss it in our next appointment when she has a bigger picture",,
IHaveTheLurgy,Sat 27-Feb-16 08:39:48,"As background, I started drinking heavily at 14. Through 14-15 I would drink most nights, often alone. Small bottles of spirits in a night and that horrible strong cider. I cut right back until about 18-19 when I was out clubbing 5 nights a week and drinking an unbelievable amount. Continued to get very drunk at least three times a week all through my 20s. Calmed down in my thirties, only really drinking at home one night a week. I have a young DD. I sometimes have a few drinks at home once she's in bed. I often find that after one or two drinks I want more, want to get more drunk. I would never go out to buy more and I don't have loads at home so it's not an issue of me getting carried away and not being able to stop. I have always suffered from anxiety and depression, I remember feeling depressed in junior school. I love the happy, lightheaded feeling of being tipsy but know it always comes with the price of feeling beyond low the next day. Anxiety through the roof and horrible depressive thoughts. I get so stressed and I'm irritable. Even after one glass of wine I'm horrible to be around the next day. It has a knock on effect to our DD, I am much less able to cope with her and I'm grumpy with her. At the weekend I went out for the first time in about 6 years and got properly wasted. The next day was so so awful. Mentally. I felt like I'd never recover. I've been having panic attacks since. I said stuff I shouldn't and having massive guilt, questioning everything, feeling like it's the end of the world. I don't have any local friends and whenever I feel like I'm about to make one I pull back because I know they're going to suggest going out for drinks and I just don't want to be around it. I feel like I'm the odd one out, socially. No one else is like this. I'm a pariah. Sorry, this is more of a rant and just getting it out. I think I've answered my own question.",,
Imcrackingup,Sun 09-Oct-16 21:50:33,"wind I emphasise with so much you've said. I am currently not in a good place, very similar situation to you, on meds, seeing a psychiatrist and struggling...But I was suicidally depressed a long time ago - I'm not quite that bad at the moment and I am not going back there. I can't - I'm terrified of going there again. I don't think I would survive. So I am doing everything in my power not to. It is hard but I know it can only get worse if I don't. I don't think I have a choice I think the worst thing is having too much time to think and nothing positive to think about. Is there something- anything - you can do to occupy your time/mind? Even doing puzzles or an online course - anything as long as you have something else to think about apart from you and your life. And preferably using your brain - things like gardening are good to keep busy but you also have the opportunity to think - to analyse and that isn't all a good thing. I think I would drop job hunting for now - it would give you a purpose but it could back fire. I have a very part time flexible job -work from home, not well paid, no real future. It does give me something to think about but then it also makes things harder as I struggle to do things I have to and feel like I am fucking that up to...even though there is noone really to discipline me. Lack of concentration/focus - everything - makes it so much harder -so I am frustrated and angry with myself too...for making it harder than it needs to be. What I am doing is making a real effort to make small changes...take fairy steps. It is hard -but I really don't think I have a choice -unless I just give up and I am not ready for that yet (plus I have DCs and I can't do that to them - I knew someone whose DM committed suicide - they never got over it).Which means doing little things - like I get dressed as soon as I get out of bed - not washed and dressed, not showered, not dressed enough to go out but not still in my PJs. I straighten the bed - a psychological plus. Then I waste hours staring at a computer screen - not doing my work ...playing solitaire or on MN ..anything but what I should be doing.I also try and keep the house vaguely tidy - so force myself to do certain jobs on certain days. Nothing huge - just hoover one room, empty the bins, etc. Then I feel like I've achieved something. Also I have lots (hundreds!) of silly little jobs like tidy a kitchen drawer - I have them on a to do list -I add to it when I see something and try and do one every few days/week. Ticking it off a list and seeing things ticked off also lets you know what you have achieved. I also try and reorganise things like drawers - something to think about whilst doing them. I have also been trying to force myself to walk rather than drive to the local shop (10-15mins in total). Exercise is really good for your mental health but again it lets your mind wander - I have been walking fighting back the tears, feeling terrible. And frightened that I felt like carrying on walking- I was thinking about someone who did that - committed suicide in a remote but beautiful place and they walked miles to get there. You really have to do something /anything - no matter what, no matter how small to start moving forward...don't worry about the past - you can't change it. Don't worry about the future just now. Worry about surviving - and you can deal with the future when you are stronger. Don't let yourself think about anything but here and now and tiny positive achievementsI fucking hate Depression - it is hell . But I know it can pass and you will be able to find small amounts of happiness -just it is hard to believe that ",,
Imogenblue,Mon 20-Feb-17 00:11:38,"This may not go down well, I don't know, I'm just stuck and unsure as to what I should do.Diagnosed with depression and anxiety, always been told to take meds for it but never have. One primary reason is that I continually worry about side affects (I don't even take pain killers). Another -probably lesser reason to many people- is what happened when I was given a prescription for some at the pharmacy and was taken into a small room. Basically, I was told I needed to be an active person or I was going to put on a lot of weight on the meds. Really not what you want to hear when already depressed. However, the only exercise I can do is walking (various problems, waiting for physio) and not for long.

Lots of us think you would benefit from medication. There have also been repeated posts advising you to stop expressing, or at a minimum stop doing it so frequently.

Afterwards I saw the crisis team regularly and realised that:1) Most of the team knew a lot less than me.2) Because the team changed so often there was little continuity3) The NHS could not provide what I wanted - which was long term, high quality psychotherapyand 4) The best person to manage my condition was.....me.Now I have a plan in place for those periods when I am actively suicidal which involves telling my DP how I feel, being nice to myself, spending time with friends even when I don't want to, staying physically active, chanting positive mantras and if that doesn't help I see a private counsellor for a few sessions.

My DS is 2.5 and I have a newborn so will be able to manage the early wake up with excitement, enthusiasm and selflessness instead of sickness, despair and resentment.I will be able to focus on my family, my brother and his new wife, my parents - instead of obsessing about how I can force my will on the situation to get another drink.As the day goes on, I will be present, available and considerate of everyone there - instead of slowly descending into a self pitying, selfish and irresponsible liability.All of these things remind me why that just one drink is not an option for me and have made it incredibly easy as my sobriety increases to feel comfortable about not drinking alcohol and able to thoroughly enjoy social situations without alcohol.That said, I do consider invitations carefully - if a party or other gathering involves mostly people you don't get on with that well (and would therefore usually need alcohol to hide behind), then be kind to yourself and put your sobriety first by politely declining. If you really have to go, then as pp have said, make sure you are able to leave at any time should you feel uncomfortable or wobbly in any way.It's completely true that most other people do not care whether you are drinking or not - it's only our own warped obsession with alcohol and how much or what everyone else us drinking that is part of this disease. As others have said (sorry can't see on the app to name check) a breezy order for a soft drink rather tHan a stuttering apology and lots of excuses is the way forward.AA saved my life but sharing in other ways outside of meetings is what I need to work on so I am really pleased to have found this topic, found this thread and found all you lovely sober people!Have a great day everyone.",,
kerstina,Sun 12-Feb-17 10:57:09, Sorry I am so late replying I have had a week from hell so poorly ended up in hospital A&E three times . Got so dehydrated had to have a drip as was choking and gagging couldn't eat or drink anything for a week . So disappointed with my doctor as the only help he offered to help with withdrawal was an app for my phone then when I felt like I was dying more or less said he didn't believe it was anxiety that I must be physically ill as I looked so unwell. So much for mental health being a priority they don't want to know unless you are suicidal . How are you now mummy squirrel please keep in touch ?,,
Ladybird1979,Sat 18-Feb-17 09:18:03,Don't just stop it. It takes 2 weeks to work into your system so be patient. You need to be weaned off - i had exactly same issue but no one told me I couldn't just stop taking them. I ceased and became suicidal and self harmed badly.Please don't just stop go to see your GP.I ended up controlling my depression and anxiety through exercise which helped so much and gradually came off the pills.,,
LadyG,Tue 02-Feb-10 21:42:44,Zahora I don't 'buy it ' 100% either but I don't think you have to in order to benefit. I imagine getting to that place of equilibrium where one can really see the joy in everyday is a slow process! However I do feel sometimes it helps me regain a sense of perspective when dealing with the multiple trivial but trying things that children bring to ones life... Speaking as someone who has been pretty depressed recently you do sound depressed. For me it was the realisation that even things that ought to be 'pleasurable' eg spending time with family and friends even getting some time shopping on my own (took a day off work to go Christmas shopping) seemed worthless and a burden. This has made me realise that I am in a depression albeit 'reactive' and this negative person is not the one that I want to be for the rest of my life.When I do manage to 'switch off' my crazy mind it does give me so much relief and I have had 'glimpses' of that pure pleasure you speak of.  Can you try sleep management techniques? (won't give you advice about that as my four and a half year old regularly gets into our bed-I don't even wake up so haven't been able to do much about it-the 18 month old is a darling and never gets up....)How about counselling? Further study either with a view to work or purely for pleasure? A book club? Rediscovering old interests? I used to really love music and hadn't listened to anything new for 5 years or so. Spent the last couple of months discovering and downloading new or 'new to me' bands-online in my kitchen. I relate to your feelings so much and would have felt as you do had I become a stay at home mum-and I am sure so many many others do and hopefully will be along with words of greater wisdom..,,
lastminute,Wed 09-Nov-11 10:44:51,"Wow, it's so good to read this thread. I feel for you all who cannot come to terms with their choice to have children. It is such a taboo to even consider not to have them that I fully understand why you decided to go for it. But you can only find out how it is for you when you have them, so don't ever blame yourself, just try to make the most of it for your kids and try to find time for you.My story is a bit different. I have a husband who is 10 years younger than I am and we started talking about having a child when we met and I was 37. I never really had the strong feeling I wanted to become a mother. I have 4 older sisters and many friends who all have children, so during the years I have baby sitted many and seen so much of what it all entitles. So I always doubted if this was good for me. I have always had a good career, travelled the world, partied a lot, love my own time. But with a husband who is 10 years younger I started to think this might be a good thing to do to have a child. He wanted it, but not so strong as to stop smoking for instance, so that made me frustrated, because we had to go through a hospital procedure when it turned out his seed wasn't the best. I stopped smoking, had 5 years of treatments on and off, which made me very unstable due to hormones, miscarriages, operations etc. He just lived his live..At 42 years old the hospital told us to stop treatments, so I felt completely relieved in some way that I tried, wouldn't regret not trying and it didn't work out for us. So we made plans for the future without kids and he was fine with this. Than...I became naturally pregnant at 44! I was panicking, couldn't feel good about this pregnancy, felt too old, not capable of doing this anymore. Everyone told me I look so young and that it would be ok and I would be a good mum. But I didn't feel that way, I became depressed, slept all day, wouldn't see anyone. My husband wanted to keep the baby, but I just couldn't connect with the feeling I was becoming a mum. He said I was negative and should focus on all the good things it would bring to our life. He also said that the first two years would really be my responsibility because he was too busy in his job...at 44 I was afraid I couldn't find the energy anymore, no way! I also thought of being 50 and have a 5 year old, 60 and have a teenager in the house, holidays with one child bored next to us or having to bring somebody else their kid on our holiday to make it nice for the kid... I come from a large family and all I could think of is that this wasn't what I envisioned to be my life and also not for the child. And after months of thinking decided to end the pregnancy...It was sheer horror, hell, something you do not wish your worst enemy to go through. Especially since my husband dropped me of at the hospital and left me alone to go through the procedure and started calling me that he was crying when it was too late..it was so painful. But now the good thing. I feel very relieved that I took this decision and trusted my own feelings. It is difficult now with my husband, but he seems to understand my decision. For him it is so different, he has no friends with babies, hasn't seen what I saw what they go through. That is how many people start with kids, very naive, no idea what they are getting into.There is such a social pressure everywhere that having kids is magical and the best thing there is in life. Think of my parents in law who didn't sleep for weeks because of my doubts..my mum understood me and was a great support. We are planning a holiday now to Asia to have a relaxing time and I'm slowly starting back to work again. I have no regrets fortunately, although I still feel guilt about breaking off a healthy pregnancy. I wish you mothers lot's of support, it really does get better, I see this with all my friends. And start working again, it's so important to have your own life, also for the kids! I also wrote this for all the women who are in doubt, please realize what you want before you become pregnant. I never thought I would become pregnant anymore but I did and to take that decision is heart breaking. I do blame myself for this.",,
Latara,Mon 23-Jul-12 10:51:24,"I'm on 225mg Venlafaxine M/R daily - it took 3 months to work properly so you have to be patient - but it's definitely been worth it & i recommend trying it!I still get short depressive periods (& feel suicidal at times) for an hour or a few hours during mood swings (got BPD). Often this happens daily; but as soon as the depressive period passes off i feel ok, like i was never depressed.Like today; i feel very happy & lively.If you have epilepsy - be aware that Venlafaxine lowers the seizure threshold - that's the one side effect that is a problem for me - i don't get full tonic-clonic seizures thanks to my epilepsy meds, but it's not fully controlled. So i get very short absence, myoclonic & deja vu seizures daily; & those seizures contribute to memory loss which is frustrating... Oh yes & best to avoid alcohol, even 1 glass of wine stops Venlafaxine being effective for me for up to 2 days later.You may feel hungrier so snack on apples / Ryvita & jam - nothing fattening.I'm happy to put up with less controlled epilepsy though as it means not getting the horrible depression i had; just would not wish bad depression on anyone.Good luck, you definitely should try it - i don't remember any other side effects but you may get drowsy etc for a while - but hopefully that will wear off after few weeks.",,
lazyminimoo,Sat 23-Apr-16 02:41:52, Yes i have really regretted having my son as i have depression social anxiety an i feel like he shouldn't have to have me for a mum an i feel like i would be less depressed if i didn't have to worry about how I'm affecting him and how hes gong to grow up feeling regretful and sad that he has a mum like me . Its just guilt that i wouldn't have to have if i didn't have a child. I don't want him gone but i at times feel it would have been best all round if i hadn't had him or if only id have had him adopted so his life would turn out better and i wouldn't feel so bad and worry all the time about how I'm not being a good mum an he deserves much better . I have mostly thought yes in a heartbeat i would go back In time an have the abortion I was planning to have but didn't because the dad begged me not to an i didn't wanna lose him as he would have dumped me if i had aborted . I sometimes think maybe i was selfish not aborting him as he now has a life that i feel is worse then most 3 year olds lives because they have nice normal mum's not socially anxious depressive mums .,,
leftfork,Wed 12-Sep-12 11:33:26,"Wonderful ladies,Been following this post for at least 18 months. You've made me feel less confused for which I thank you all. Similar story. DH wanted children, I didn't see the point, I had a great life. 4.5 years later here we are. I was right, I haven't had the light bulb moment and maybe I never will.Feeno,I remember being in a similar situation 2.5 years ago. Eldest child 21 months, 2nd child due, moving town at 37 weeks pregnant and completely depressed at the thought of child number 2. I didn't realise it then but I suffered from depression because I didn't want the kids but only talked to the GP recently - wish I had done it 2 years ago.As other ladies suggest do try and find some time for your self. You have a lot going on but just try and pick one thing. Maybe get Hubbie to take your child all day saturday (are there any Dad's group where you live?) while you do something you really miss doing, even if it's just reading Hello/newspaper the whole day.Anyway, I want to tell you it does get easier. By that I don't mean that you will suddenly love motherhood - I certainly don't but it's little things. My two keep each other company for 20-30 mins at a time now. I even found myself reading a book while with them yesterday .",,
LifeAsWeKnowIt,Sun 19-Feb-17 23:33:26,"I am in desperate need of help. I'm 21 All my life I have had trouble with so many things; I used to self harm I am severely depressed (on tablets) Have anxiety to the max (also on tablets) I cannot tell the time unless it's 12hr I don't know my left and rights I have the shortest attention span My short term memory is atrocious I often get my words muddled up when talking I'm over sensitive to noise (I hate the cinema and nightclubs) I'm impulsive, I need things yesterday!! I have barely any sense of time, speed, distance etc. I find it hard to follow instructions (my mum used to ask my to run upstairs get her 2 things and I'd always forget) I'm always late and forget the most important things such as my theory test even though I've got it written down and panic that id forget I talk excessively to the point I feel like I am going to explode I can't spell for shit. Without autocorrect and google it would look like a 6 year old wrote this I procrastinate to the extreme I have trouble staying motivatedMy school reports were ""So and So is clever but is easily distracted, she needs to apply herself more and work harder"" I left school with 1 GCSE and I feel I was failed! I had extra lessons outside of school as well. I was tested for dyslexia in college came back I had it but it was never noted nor taken into account. I was suspended often and had a lot of dentitions. I really do want to learn but I could never understand and if I didn't get it I never did but if I got it I excelled. Anyway I really need to get a diagnosis as I'm doing a degree from home and I need to be able to put down my problems so my tutor is aware and it is taken into account unlike at school. It's a struggle when people think you are dumb, maybe I am but I need help either way! Thank you if you got this far, I hope someone can guide me in the right direction. Also my parents put it down to me being 'dumb' so that is all I've known to be but I think there is a big underlying problem.",,
lifeinruins,Sat 05-Sep-15 03:52:27,"I need to put this ""out there"". Unlike many people on this thread, I am not technically a SAHM. I am currently studying at university, doing an honours level degree part time. This is for a career change. It's tough and I must have top marks in order to proceed further.I used to have a career in IT. I had a 6-figure salary. I knew for many years that it wasn't for me, that I didn't enjoy it, and so I started studying part time - slowly preparing to step out. I had a small but beautiful Victorian-era house. I could afford my own mortgage, my own lifestyle. I do have a history of anxiety and depression though, but I learned to manage it.I married my best friend, whom I love dearly. I always thought that I had to have a child - my biological clock was saying so, my family was saying so - it was just ""one of those things"", even though I am not maternal and don't like children - but I was convinced (primarily by my mother) that it wouldn't matter because it is different with one's own child.I got pregnant on the night we got engaged. My husband wanted the child - me: well, the timing was horrid (I just changed, jobs, was in 3rd year of my degree, we were planning a wedding and honeymoon and to just enjoy being a couple)... but I wasn't going to have an abortion. So - we had a beautiful baby girl. Because there was no way I could have enough time and energy to hold a fulltime job and study successfully enough to be able to achieve the level I needed, it was decided that I would leave my job and IT and concentrate on the studies and motherhood. My husband makes a very good salary, and we could afford it. What we could not afford was a larger place, so we all moved into my small house. It became very crowded, the decor haphazard, but it had to happen (partly of me - I refused to move out of my home when I found out I was pregnant. I am very home bound, and, by then, with my biological instinct having calmed down, I already realised what a horrible mistake I made. That I didn't want a child at all. That I treasured my life as it was. But it was too late.)My daughter is 18 months now. She goes to a good child care place 4 days a week. She gets sick with minor colds a lot, which she has to stay home for quite often, but we have support from both grandmothers. I get to study - something I enjoy a lot.And, still, I am MISERABLE! I love my daughter, I am a very good mother. I don't lose it with her, I am practicing respectful parenting, I keep my depression at bay most of the time, when I am around her.... and I HATE MY LIFE.I pop 10 pills a day to keep the depression at bay. I've seen a psychologist but there's nothing really that can be done because I am not being delusional - my life has changed in exact ways I see, with some good things (you know, those moments of connection with the child, watching her grow, etc etc), but many of the changes I hate and, overall, the good does not in any way, shape or form make up for the bad. I can't lie to myself, I can't forget about it, I can't ignore it. I used to be a beautiful energetic person, who took a lot of pride in her appearance, was VERY fit, and was sexual. I am too tired now - I don't have energy/time/or am sick with the latest virus my daughter brought into the house, which saps energy even more. I have not enjoyed sex since the day my daughter was born. I participate in it for my husband's sake. I live in jeans and jumpers - those that I don't care whether they get stained or not. I don't even remember what is in my closets, let alone remember how to dress up (and, oh boy, did I used to - I used to favour gothic clothing and make up).My house I already mentioned - there are things constantly in need of fixing, cleaning, it's got plastic boxes and computer things everywhere, because we have no where to put them - and no energy to really sort things out and throw things out. My beautiful house is no longer a place of pride and joy for me - it's still my home though.Because I have left my career, and because of where I was in my career at the time I left (transitioning from a programmer to a project manager, but not having yet enough time in the manager's role to be able to get job as one, and, now being out too long from a position of a programmer - 5 years away from cutting-edge stuff is a VERY LONG TIME in this industry), I don't think I could possibly get a job which will allow me to support myself... and this is something I always was able to do. I am holding onto my studies, but I am so, so exhausted. I am not sure I can keep that up and it's still 4 years before I can actually start working in the new field.My husband is exhausted too - he always understood me, understood my mental health issues, was always supportive, but he is feeling hopeless. There's nothing he can do (any more than he already can, given that he has to hold down the job to pay for us all). We've all been living with the idea that ""it's going to get better"" - but, 18 months later - it isn't. Every time I have to spend more than 1 hour on my own with my daughter I end up looking at the clock every 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes counting down to when someone else can take over. I always have to push the thought away of ""I'd rather be elsewhere, do something else"". Lately, that something else has been ""sleep"". I just want to sleep. It's depression and I am tired of fighting it, and I have assignments due, so I can't just sleep the days away.We've started talking about my husband and daughter moving out to his mother's. He doesn't want to. His mother, of course, wouldn't want him to. I don't want him to. But I don't want to be paying this price. I don't want to be a shadow of myself. I want my life back, so much (even though I know I can't have it back - because I want a life with my husband, whom I love... but without my daughter!!!!) I love her too, very much... but I love myself more! And it's selfish and horrid, but I do!I do.",,
Lilipops,Mon 13-Feb-17 17:55:44,"I have been taking a low dose of Prozac (fluoxetine) for a good few years and generally I think they help. However, although I am much more tolerant and calm about things, I just feel slightly that I am not 'me'. I definitely get on with my husband much better when I'm on them as I don't question anything, I.e. Problems within our relationship. I am not sure if I am depressed as opposed to just not happy and taking them just numbs everything. I feel that when I come off them (I have just run out and so haven't taken any for a few days) I am much less accepting of things in my life. I wonder if I stop taking them I might do something about my life as I will feel the need to sort things out. I might push my husband to try to go to marriage counselling or something rather than just trudging along as we are. I don't know where to go or who to talk to for help. I don't know if I will be wasting the doctors time if I make an appointment to talk to them about it as ultimately it's my decision.

Linds53,Fri 06-Jan-17 20:35:33," He will seem depressed and will spend a lot of time sleeping. Alcoholism does that to a person. There's no point wondering which came first, because the fact is that alcohol is now the problem. His doctor can't/won't treat him for depression while he's abusing alcohol. Knowing he needs help isn't necessarily a big step. My husband in his rare sober moments realised he had a problem. When he was dying he told me it was 'self-inflicted injury'. Action is the only thing which will make a difference and the decision to act must come from him. Anything you say to him while he is drunk/needing a drink is wasted breath. He won't be listening. I'm sorry if that seems harsh. I have so much sympathy for you. It is hell, but the important thing to remember is that whatever happens you don't need to be pulled down with him.",,
Linds53,Sun 10-May-15 01:08:35," Yes we had kids and it was horrendous for them, watching the dad they loved destroyed by drink. It took me a long time to figure out that he had a drink problem. I thought he was seriously depressed and made all kinds of allowances. But he became unreliable, aggressive and frightening and I allowed it to continue for far too long as I was desperate to repair him and hold our family together. It was only when I got in touch with alanon that I realised I was enabling him by making excuses for his behaviour and protecting him from the consequences of his actions. Now he has gone I can see all the mistakes I made but at the time I was just so anxious for our lives to return to 'normal'. It was only when he became violent that we separated. To be honest Dexter, my kids didn't cope. They really suffered. My husband was unrecognisable by the end. He looked like a man in his eighties and he had basically lost his mind. Cirrhosis is a horrible way to die.",,

LuluBlue,Tue 01-Mar-11 18:08:44,"This morning I made my first post on another thread (on being nonmaternal), before I found this one. I am 38 yrs old, 8 weeks pregnant with my first and am horribly depressed and ambivalent. I have never felt maternal, had sworn off children-- a choice that my husband (who is much more a ""broody type"") respected, while most likely harboring the hope that I would someday see the light. Well, here I am, entering the 2nd month of an unplanned pregnancy and I am just nothing but blind-terrified of everything I read in this thread-- because it resonates, all of it. The loss of self, the depression, the resentment. I nodded so much as I read--the idea that parenthood in general is a sort of conspiracy... I just wanted to say that I am grateful for everyone's candor. What you are confirming are the worst fears I have for motherhood myself. I have friends who swear up and down that they felt as I did but then the baby arrived and -- poof!--it's been nothing but rainbows and chickadees ever since. I know that they are probably also shielding me from the worst of it, for both of our sakes. That said, I also truly believe that some women are meant to be mothers-- that they really have that ""calling."" That they enjoy it naturally and weather the lumps and bumps of it so much easier that types like me who never felt remotely interested in the first place. I know that even posting these thoughts anonymously could not have been easy, since to admit maternal regret is the last bastion of taboo in this very childcentric world. I hope many of the women here can feel better just for knowing that they are far from alone in their thoughts. And I just want to say, to InPraiseofBacchus and others, that this thread HAS made a difference. To me anyway. It is not yet too late for me, though time is wasting. I think I have decided for good to terminate and will make the appointment today. I do hope somenone might respond to this, if only to let me know that my thougts, too, were heard.

They have a term for it here ""Wards without Walls"" - you couldn't make it up!!Incidentally OP it isn't only ""hearing voices"" that prompts an admission. It's true that if someone is suffering a psychotic illness (with hearing voices being a symptom) and is not taking the meds, they may need to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The nature of this illness is that people are deluded so are convinced they are not ill and it's the people around them who are deluded! In such a state they need to be protected for themselves and others. A person can be sectioned if they are a danger to themself or others, and this can be the case for any mental illness.Crisis teams in my experience are not much help - in our MH Trust they will simply tell someone to go to A & E as there is a MH liaison post in A & E. which I suppose is better than nothing. Mind a person would almost certainly have to wait for an age for the the MH liaison person. Of course staff are in a very difficult position knowing that there are no beds available for people who are in desperate need. They will try other hospitals in the trust or further afield, but it's just not right that patients have to travel 30 or more miles away from their home, which can be the case.Upondown do you mind my asking about your mental illness - am assuming it is depression as suicidal thoughts are very common with this illness. Do you mean you are having these thoughts (known as suicide ideation) but don't really think you will act upon them, or is it more serious, and you have made plans. It sounds like it could be the latter as the CMHT are in close contact. Please take all the help you can get. Hope you have someone close at hand who understands the torment of mental illness and can support you.",,
magnificatAnimaMea,Tue 08-Mar-16 19:22:50,"Thanks for the perspectives.Whereyouleftit re complicity - I think it's safe to say that when Friend 2 has had an alcohol problem for the last 35 years, there's not much point me saying ""I don't want to know about your alcohol problem"". He's likely to have it on display whether we want to know or not... and we all want to be better friends with him so he can get more of a sense of self that isn't about drinking himself to oblivion, having no confidence, regret, etc. He's bloody marvellous, when he's not drunk or depressed & wallowing.Xmasbaby11- i totally agree that they're adults and am not aiming to do anything other than (1) be their friends and (2) make sure there's a strong support network available for each of them when it all inevitably goes tits-up - however, I'm just trying to be sensitive to friend 1's needs, since this would be the first time we've had her round and offered alcohol. I think it's up to her if she drinks, but I don't want to put her in the position of being in a social situation where she's having to try desperately not to drink, or feeling like crap because she wants to drink and can't in public. She tends to beat herself up about it a lot. However, ""warning"" her about it makes it obvious i know she isn't dry. That's a whole other can of worms that might be safer not to open.Re the moderate drinkers - they're pretty sensitive, and are likely to drink only one or two glasses of wine at most in a situation like this as they would be aware they might need to drive the others home. At past gatherings involving friend 1, they have typically not drunk alcohol at all.",,
magnificatAnimaMea,Sun 15-Nov-15 19:35:23,"A friend has had serious alcohol issues in the past - including time in rehab and in the local hospital's psychiatric ward with severe depression, suicidal ideation, etc. In many aspects her life is ""back on track"", but she has continued to drink at a very low level, and the level has been creeping up in the last few months to the point that people are beginning to notice.We all live in a small town; the old friends she has know her history intimately and know the reasons she may once again be struggling. But anyone who has attempted to discuss it with her has been cut off from ""good"" friend to ""superficial social politeness"" friend - and she is gradually becoming isolated in that group. She does seem to have friends at work, all of whom would see people with addiction problems regularly and thus would realise what the problem is, but I don't think she socializes with them much.She is in danger of losing her job, which is the central element of her successfully rebuilding herself and her life. Her profession has a one-strike-and-you're-out policy. She knows this, but is drinking at a level where her blood alcohol might be over the limit the morning after the night before.Is there any way any of us can broach this without simply getting cut off? i am as close as anyone to her - I tried to talk to her nearly a year ago, and it did seem to work for a while, but she had less to worry about then, than she does now.I know she needs help from AA. I know she needs to choose to ask for help. But part of her problem is probably that she feels isolated, while isolating herself. Somehow we need to make her feel less isolated.",,

MaximilianNero,Sun 17-Jul-16 03:33:41,"I'm becoming convinced that I have ADHD as well as ASD. I did that test thing and got 6/6 and 9/12. This thread describes so much of what i experience.I have an addictive type personality...I can be completely obsesed with something, but then a switch will flip and suddenly I will completely lose all interest. I got to Candy Crush over level 1000 and then the switch flipped and I've had no desire to touch it since. If I want to stop something, it has to be cold turkey. To use the cigarette example, I am not one of those people who could cut from 20 to 15 to 10 a day and so on. It's cold turkey or nothing. I had to do that with the lottery most recently. No ability to stick to my spending limit. I constantly get hooked on researching or reading the next thing, and then move on. Never tried recreational drugs though, and never even had a cup of coffee because I hate the taste so much.I have 4 unfinished projects in my line of sight. No wait, 5Impulsive....very impulsive purchaser, cannot learn the lessons of previous stupidity. I know I should food shop on a full stomach. I KNOW I should. But I don't. Broken the law on impulse before and then thought 'oh you idiot, why'd you do that??'. Nearly get run over crossing the road because I won't wait for the green man. ""ooh, yes, I'll book flights to xyz for next week"". My pattern is always to impulsively book something and then have to frantically research to produce a tight plan to avoid extreme ASD anxiety. The sensible person would surely research first (sigh)Extremely restless and fidgety constantly. Often compelled to get up and start leaping around. Always put that solely down to ASD.Often miss part of people's sentences, cannot focus on what people are saying for long. Reread book sentences multiple times to take it in.Mind everywhere. Unless I'm obsessing on something, it's jumping from one thing to the next to the next. It's like something physically pulls my mind onto another focus, I have so little control over it  It's not necessarily any other particular thought either, it's maybe just nothing, I just slide out of focus so I'm staring at a wall with no concrete thoughts in my mind. It's this mind-everywhere and inability to concentrate that cause me difficulties work-wise. Coupled with indecision. For instance, I'm trying to choose a chocolate bar in Tesco. One of two bars. I will stand in that aisle for 10 or 15 entire minutes while I feel vaguely confused and my mind slides everywhere and then back to the chocolate bars but i have no idea which to have and can't squarely focus my mind on the bars for long, and rinse and repeat while I get more and more stressed out. Over a fecking chocolate bar.Mood swings all the time. Treated for depression before, but actually successfully, no longer clinically depressed, I just get sad mood swings. Very easily frustrated. I clean only in binges. Housework, cleaning and organisation are all or nothing events. Terrible at doing things that need doing, procrastinator extraordinaire, horrible organisation, require to-do lists to remember things, always misplacing my keys etc in my room and having to tip it upside down.",,

I'm not an expert on this but in case it helps I have recently had some CBT (I didn't have severe problems/suicidal thoughts or anything but I felt myself starting to lose my grip and didn't want it going out if control). It was scary thinking about it because i sort of didn't want to confront myself. I wasn't sure what the problem was exactly, except that I didn't like myself and wasn't happy that I was (over)reacting badly to things and had got myself stuck in a pattern of behaviour I could see but not stop. My therapist asked me some questions and we picked a particular place to start and went from there. It really helped me although it was a bit scary to start with. I feel like I have tools to spot the behaviour patterns I was stuck in and alter them. I'm so glad I did it. I hope you get an appointment soon and it helps.",,
MeadowHay,Wed 11-Jan-17 22:58:29,"Welcome everyone . Delete Well done on going to see your GP, that is a big step and means you are on your way to recovery. Good luck with the sertraline, it can take 4-5 weeks for antidepressants to really start working so stick with it and side-effects mostly wear off after the first couple of weeks too for most people. When I first started citalopram a few years ago I was dreadfully ill for the first week with a vast array of side effects, they gradually lessened in the second week and then most of them went away bar a few trivial things and then the medicine really helped me for a few years. Lollipop Glad your placement is still going well. I went to see my dad this evening and had a nice meal out with him which was nice. Tomorrow morning I have an appointment with my study advisor at uni which DH is going to take me to to make sure I actually go and help me talk to her in case I can't talk due to anxiety. It will be about my presentation and to see if there is anything she can do to help me with it . Testi Christmas is often a particularly tough time for people.

I can't really go anywhere on my own other than uni and work - which is the same place as I work in my SU. It is horrible feeling trapped at home sometimes. Rachie Sorry to hear you're feeling bad anxiety-wise. If you're really struggling, make that GP appt, they can help you. Inside Also sorry to hear how low you're feeling, please try to keep safe. If you need to talk you can call Samaritans remember or if you're in urgent crisis situation you can call 999 or go to A&E.

I am up so early this morning and feel not too exhausted/sleepy which is a big achievement. I am about to go to work now.

Melaniefhappy,Wed 15-Jul-09 21:06:03,"Hi everyone,I totally empathise with all said below. I had a great career, followed by a period as a very happy and busy independent consultant. WE then decided to have children but so far, ONE of us has a satisfying, enjoyable, stimulating career, and the other one battles depression on a daily basis. I know that I am not SAHM material but early on, with two kids very close together, we could not afford simultaneous nursery fees (over å£2000 in our area, per month). I could not continue in consultancy due to the hours but a part-time role would not have covered the å£2K a month (pre tax). Now my youngest is going to school in Sept and I am delighted (as is she) but I know that if I want to return to work for someone else it will be ME that does it all ....AND work! By this I mean it will be ME doing the packed lunches, book bags, getting kids up, ironing outfits, driving to school, and all other admin as necessary- all before work then it will be (you guessed it) ...ME picking up kids - oh an 18 hour day YIPPIE!!! Just to get some intellectual stimulation and not to be alone 24/7. The loneliness I feel is crippling. Believe me I am trying everything to find a solution. At every step it is my life that comes last. He cannot drive to school due to working 1.5 hours away. When the children were tiny I genuinely felt suicidal and would call him to bring home a bottle of wine (which I would polish off). I still feel incredibly trapped, professionally resentful and deceived. I wish I had the energy to write a book for women trying to decide whether to have children ....confirming that if men they say they'll be involved they WON'T BE as they CAN'T BE!!! Society, and the way jobs work, means that men cannot support us as they wish to, and the extended family has more or less decided to follow golf, art or another lovely activity. It was the latter that I found overwhelming also- the grandparents that I had asked for support PRE birth were not surely those that buggered off and played golf POST birth. Too selfish to help regularly is the reality- ours all live locally (less than five miles) but have golf, art, riding etc!!!!. If they knew how close they had come to not having a daughter in law to cook the sodding Christmas lunch then perhaps they would have helped more, instead of (one set in particular) waiting for their perfect daughter to finally produce offspring (which I know they would find it in their heart to help with). SORRY!!! Too much wine and feeling so trapped. Amazed that mumsnet features suicide/mental health help at the start of this section. Why doesn't society realise just how awful it is to educate women, give them career freedom and then imprison them at home as there is no way to combine two careers by working part-time each and pay the mortgage etc?Thanks for readingTired, lonely, love the kids but wish WE looked after them instead of ME ALL THE TIME.",,

Lots of other awful things happened at the same time that took up a lot of my brain space. But was kind of ok. Or so I thought.Anyway, in the last six months I am in bits with anxiety and all the rest of it. It's coming to the surface again.

Gave me a script and I filled it, but I am full of anxiety and will not take them. I know, but that's me.I am not taking any other meds at all for anything else. He also gave me a weeks supply of 3mg Lexotan to take if I get panicky. They are god's gift, but I have to be careful not to become dependent on them.Jesus will this anxiety ever go away.

I recently posted elsewhere about feeling dp and i needed time away from dd and that we had only had 4 days away from dd this year.

I had moments wen I was extremely angry and had to really control myself. I was irrational and emotional. I almost divorced my husband. Finally I couldn't even sleep at night as my head was full of anxiety and suicide looked to me like a very tempting option.

Maybe a bit of depression is making you feel so bad about yourself. Maybe because you feel lonely, you are focusing on your looks when in reality you are a bit depressed that in turn can make you feel down, lonely and unhappy and you are maybe blaming how others interact with you on your looks?

Niori,Wed 13-May-15 19:20:35,"Hi RainbowUntil July last year, I'd crept up from drinking a couple of glasses a week over a number of years to a full wine box a night. I tried to stop on my own - I couldn't.Alcoholism is an illness, and it's progressive. An alcoholics body doesn't deal with booze in the same way as a non alcoholics. Drinking causes us to crave more...hence why I could never stop at 'just one or two'. once I started, I had to continue, and one or two turned into 3-4 bottles a night without me ever really wanting to drink that. The only treatment for that physical craving is abstinence. However if you are an alcoholic, putting the drink down isn't enough, because we're not only physically hooked, we're mentally obsessed too. As to the reasons why I drank, it became the only time that I ever felt good in my own skin. Without drink, I was absolutely miserable, so even when I did manage to not drink I wasn't doing well mentally or emotionally. I was angry, anxious, depressed.I never drank to get drunk, I drank to feel ok.I joined AA a little over ten months ago, and I haven't had a drink since. It saved my life. I'm doing well now, ended a bad marriage with a 'feeder' type, started to get my home life in a place where it should be, because make no mistake, this is very hard on children as we don't function as we should. On the hunt for a job at the moment and have picked up hobbys again that I left behind a long time ago. Life after booze doesn't have to be doom and gloom, we just have to work on what makes us pick up that drink in the first place  I have a far better quality of life in sobriety than I ever had before it......a year ago, I couldn't imagine life without booze and now I feel like a totally different woman. There is a way out, I promise.Best wishes",,

NolongerAnxiousCarer,Wed 22-Feb-17 21:59:30,"Firstly who knows how they would react to this till it happens, the lack of emotion could be shock in itself. Also when we are depressed we can just feel so numb, that we can't feel anything.For me self harm is a coping mechanism to release the pressure that builds up inside when stress gets too much. Sometimes it can be a way of feeling something when you are feeling too numb inside. The severity of the injury does not necessarily reflect the severity of the emotional turmoil. I rarely break the skin, but the intensity of the urges and the internal anguish is completely unbearable to get me to that point in the first place. Also generally over time you need to cut deeper to get the same relief and it can be addictive.You need to get proffesional help for both of you ASAP. Get youself and your son to the GP and get some help.",,
NolongerAnxiousCarer,Tue 21-Feb-17 21:24:43,"Hi,It can be really hard supporting someone with their MH problems. I support DH with serious MH issues and know how hard it is to see someone you love so poorly. I'm also a similar age and feel the pressure of that ticking clock.I'm taking it that your DPs depression stems from his diagnosis and he is participating in treatment, so I think TENSHIs comments are unecessarily harsh. Parents with mental illness can be good parents, just the same as parents with any other illness. ( Both DHs MH team and the children of DHs relative with the same condition assure me of this ) Besides depression is treatable and there is every chance that with time your partner will recover well. Right now your DP is probably grieving for is diagnosis and I suspect you are too.Do you have any support for you? Can you access councelling through work or your GP?The most important thing we can do for ourselves and the people we support is to look after ourselves. If we go under we can't support anyone else. Its really important to make time for you, and to do the things that you enjoy. For me it's going to the gym, but anything that you enjoy. As for supporting him when he is suicidal I have plenty of experience here too unfortunately, and also experience of feeling suicidal many years ago myself. If there is an imediate danger then if possible pursuade him to either phone the crisis team (I'm assuming thats the 24/7 number he has) or to go to A&E with you. If you don't think that you can keep him safe call 999. Another way I have accessed urgent (not immediate) help has been via 111 who sent out an out of hours GP. Samaritans are also available for both of you 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org As for day to day one of the best things you can do is to do and talk about normal stuff. If he can set himself little goals to get him through the day then fab, even if its just having a shower, getting dressed etc. Exercise can really help, as it releases your bodies natural antidepressants. Getting motivation to do it when you are depressed is really tough though. But things like going for a walk can help you to feel better.Feel free to PM me if you want.",,

NotJanine,Mon 13-Feb-17 11:42:06,"I have been suffering from mild depression and anxiety for a while now, relating to my marriage and subsequent split.I did get a prescription for anti-depressents but I couldn't bear the side-effects and stopped taking them. My main problem at the moment is anxiety and it is becoming overwhelming for me. I am going to see a counsellor which I hope will help. I know the theory behind anxiety and am fine at giving other people advice on coping, but can't do it myself.Beta blockers were mentioned to me before but the gp said they might not be suitable for me as my blood pressure is naturally quite low. However I'm starting to feel quite desparate as the anxiety is building and although I don't feel depressed as I was, I do feel it's all getting too painful to cope with and I am worried about feeling suicidal again.So I'd be interested to hear about anyone's experiences of BBs.

I missed my family terribly and I found the two big changes - having a baby (which is a life change you cannot really ever be prepared for) and moving was just the worst mix. Unfortunately just after ds2 was born our landlord sold the flat we were living in and once again, I got very depressed having to make such a big move after such a big life change.

Orangecake123,Thu 23-Feb-17 19:46:32,I was suicidal and had severe depression. I started therapy twice a week a month ago. It was something that i had tried before when I was younger but I never found helpful to be honest and the main thing is found why was the connection you have with your therapist. I found mine on:www.itsgoodtotalk.org.uk/I sent a very frank and brief outline of the main issues I was struggling with. My advice would be don't be afraid to ask questions or to message more than one at a time. There are a lot of different types of therapy. My deciding factor was just based on the way my therapist responded back to my original message. It really hasn't been easy but today I left feeling good. It's just about helping you get better.,,

I can't do anything, I have no motivation. I spent the last few days just staring blankly at the tv. I have random hours a few days a week where I feel like I'm might be ok, I get positive and a small amount of motivation then it's right back to feeling empty. I can't blame my relationship ending on this because it's been like this forever but it's intensified a lot the last few weeks. Most days I'll just sit by myself all day. I can barely bring myself to get up and shower. I don't talk to anyone. I just sit here. At work in very good at putting on a cheery front. People think I'm bubbly and friendly but it's all just so people don't ask me if I'm ok, because I feel like I will break down if someone knows how I really feel. I feel broken. And empty.

She made me cry, in the playground, (and I NEVER show emotion in public) so I don't think she'll raise it again. I felt so judged.One of the things my struggling-DC has been given as a tool in his arsenal for dealing with anxiety is a breathing technique to invoke the parasympathetic nervous system - 6 or even 5 breaths a minute. It's great for him, he's sleeping properly for the first time ever and it helps a great deal when he's stressed about something but not full on panicking. However, I do it with him - he likes the company - and I've discovered that it strips away the adrenaline that's holding me together. Three nights running I've put him to bed then dissolved into a puddle of tears because it all seems so hopeless and I've made such a terrible mess of helping him grow up.

So I gave up and am now asking for an appointment with my GP. I have talked to a friend at work (ironically, I work for a MH charity, and my boss is an ex-psych nurse) and he said she was being useless and I should ask to change CPN but I'm trying to pluck up the courage to get that in motion. I just keep thinking that if I ask to change CPN I'll be told she was right and I'm wrong and there's nothing really wrong with me and I'll be stuck with her with her being even more exasperated with me.I went into work and my boss was lovely and told me to think about whether I needed some time off or to go down to part time hours while I'm unwell. I also slept for a few hours this evening and while I got up feeling slightly giddy, I'm OK. I'm not suicidal right now - just absolutely drained. I know that depression tends to manifest in a very physical way for me - like a weight on my chest or something. And everything feels really really hard. My fiance was lovely and says that he will come with me into the CMHT if I want to make a complaint as he feels quite strongly she's being useless and he's really annoyed about the mood diary comment as he feels it's been staggeringly useful for both of us to be able to follow how my brain is working.

That was 6 years ago & I remain sober & in a very good place emotionally. Don't think about booze from one end of the year to the next. My mood is on an even keel & I wake up knowing that whatever I feel is authentic - not manipulated by the high & lows of heavy drinking. I don't believe that I have the disease of alcoholism but it took going into AA and following their programme solidly to come to that conclusion & manage my sobriety independently. I spend most of my time overseas & when I return to the UK i am struck by the national obsession with booze It is everywhere & constant social drinking has been normalised.

Pollyanna9,Sun 19-Feb-17 10:56:46,"Hi all.I've had anxiety since childhood (watching parents rowing (not on the water you understand!!) was enough to trigger that and I suppose if you wanted to label it, you could describe me as a 'high functioning' anxious person! What I mean by that is I push myself very hard to go out to work and to push myself in what can be called my 'career' - I could settle for much easier jobs but I prefer to push myself not least because I'm the main breadwinner (single parent) and have to meet all of the related financial obligations.Where you would see my anxiety would be the fact that I compulsively pick my skin so it's damaged and scarred, that if I'm going somewhere not in the normal run of journeys/destinations I plan it out to the nth degree reviewing parking, looking on streetview so I'll recognise the entrance, reviewing the parking costs and payment methods, looking at the route etc etc etc etc.When I was about 17 I discovered alcohol and the wondrous joy of being so pissed you can be at a distance from your stress and the CONSTANT feeling of heightened concern about everything. Of course I wasn't diagnosed with this when I was a child and I didn't realise what it was for a long long time. When I had my DS I was off the charts anxious resulting in me trying to control every aspect of his care (never possible with a newborn) and it ramped up to a level I couldn't believe. I would also be anxious if the kids were say jumping on the bed - in CASE they fell off and hurt themselves - again, anxiety level way over and above anything that is normal. As I say, you'd not necessarily know this is how I am if you see me/met me. But all of this I suppose trying to suppress it is working less and less and my skin picking is going mental and I just feel so hyped up all the time I can barely relax at all. I sleep badly and wake exhausted.I want to go to the GP to get something medicinal to address this. I'm not depressed - but I do need something to 'take the edge off'. What is the likelihood of getting beta blockers prescribed or there was another drug someone said on here (darn, can't remember it) that not only does it make you feel calmer but it also helps you sleep, begins with m....It's just my GPs are often SO averse to actually DOING anything for you it drives me bloody mad. I did go in about anxiety once before and was offered referral to a mental health service but it would have resulted in going to regular sessions for CBT or similar and to be honest, the thought of having to try and organise that, take time off work and so on just makes me even more stressed! I'd like to manage it in another way.So I guess I'm asking what are the key things I need to get across that are most likely to result in the GP actually taking my request seriously and looking at a prescribing route? What is it that makes them think oh ok this person needs this type of solution and I'm happy to get them it rather than let me suggest other options and not be happy to suggest ones involving drugs?I know it's never preferable to be put on pills but for myself, it would be preferable to feeling like this every day of my life.",,
Pollyanna9,Sun 19-Feb-17 11:55:07,"Thank you. I feel like I'm at the point where waiting weeks for CBT plus the weeks it would take for it to work, are not going to address quickly enough, at this time, the crushing exhaustion that goes with being anxious all the time. I do absolutely agree with CBT being the premier solution but a. the timing's not right it won't be quick enough and b. unless there are remote access options certainly at the moment, it would be a no go for me at this time (but am certainly not ruling it out for sure).I think I'm so bloody anxious about going in there and just being turned back round again that I don't know what to say to convince them that I do need some immediate help to get me over a hump. Went in there for neck pain I've had on and off for 30 years. Got told a few (pathetic) neck exercises (""roll your neck, shrug your shoulders) and if that doesn't work well, you'll have to live with it..."" !! Actually, it was postural - I had to pay to see my local fantastic physio who sorted the whole thing out for me. So my experience of the GP is that they are largely extremely unhelpful and not wanting to action actual treatments.Last time I went in about anxiety I had to be assessed at a special panel because that CCG didn't commission MH support for people who skin picked - apparently I would have gotten an immediate referral if I was cutting!Honestly. I do resent that I look after myself 99% of the time. When I go the GP it's because I've got to the point where I actually need help. And so often I either don't get it or there are barriers and I come out feeling worse than when I went in. Going to the GP could make you feel depressed when you were fine when you went in!",,

I'm so overwhelmed by things that need doing to run our home, and I'm putting jobs off thinking, I'll do that when I get a non-hangover day, but that never comes.I'm losing weekends to hangovers, and that's shit for my kids.Last week I lost actual stuff - keys, bag, purse and in my head I'm not the person that does that. Other people get drunk and lose stuff but I don't. But I did. Ugh. I put last week's units into an app and I'm shocked to see it was 80plus. Horrific.

protecttheinnocent,Wed 07-Mar-12 14:36:38,"I can really relate to this thread. I wanted children for a long time, lost a pregnancy in the 2nd tri and didn't get pregnant again for 2 years - I was nearly 40 by the time DS was born. Despite being so wanted, it was still a massive shock. I immediately regretted it and those feelings still haven't waned completely, although going back to work has greatly lessened them.I've felt all of the feelings mentioned on here over the last 2 years but I must say things are a lot better since my job improved - I've been back at work a year and am really into the swing of it again now. I still find DS very hard work though and am hopeless on the one day we have together and can't wait for bedtime - and feel guilty about that - horrendous!One thing I will say is that it has improved incrementally more and more as time has gone on. I suspect that this will only continue as he gets older.I'm also lucky enough to have 2 sets of very helpful grandparents. Without them, things would have been/would be a lot more difficult. We've managed to get away for weekends several times over the last couple of years and that has literally saved my life.What an excellent thread.",,
Purplebluebird,Tue 04-Oct-16 14:58:55,"Oh you sound very depressed  I think your therapist must have been rubbish, they should not make you feel worse - they should give you tools to cope when things are bad. Go back to your GP, ask for ADs (seriously, they can help) and therapy with someone else, because you didn't get along with the previous one.I understand it's difficult with the job situation at the moment - perhaps you could find the energy to start a hobby? You would not get rejected in a hobby club ",,
QuiteLikely5,Tue 04-Oct-16 19:28:48,Op the only way from here is up. If nothing changes then nothing changes. Try some vit D to make sure you are good in that dept. Your past is in the past and you cannot alter that. You do not need to let it define your future. A sad person would not be displaying the sort of behaviour that you are so I think that you may be medically depressed. Call the GP and let him decide. The horror of MH problems is that often it's only our inner self who can bring ourselves out of the situation and it takes effort to realise that. And without medication it really does boil down to mind over matter. Why not go back to college to retrain in a new career? Evening classes perhaps? A confidence building course?,,

Rockingaround,Thu 23-Feb-17 00:13:34,"Hi OP I have as depression since being a little girl (I'm currently on 40mg of citalopram and have been for the past 11 years) one of my first realisations/memories of ""the feeling"" was similar to what you describe, a feeling of guilt, like I'd done something terribly terribly wrong, I think I was about 9. Although I've had more than my fair share of knocks and hard times, I experienced those feelings before anything major happened in my life. I firmly believe that for many (not all) people depression is caused by the levels of seratonin our brain produces, for me I just think it's how I'm wired and the pills enable me to live a 'normal' existence. My meds increase the levels of seratonin in my brain thus enabling me to experience the happiness in my life; as opposed to only ever seeing the dark side to life - feeling low, pessimistic, hopeless, etc. It took me a long long time to come to this realisation, I spent my teens and my early twenties in a self - destructive, reckles state tbh - trying counselling, cbt, natural remedies, meditation, courses, excersise etc etc etc. I don't know if anything has happened recently to trigger these feelings for you?Depression is so complex and unforgiving, like I've said, for some of us it just looms.  Is it vaguely similar to when you had PND? And, how did you get through it then? I've never taken Prozac so not sure of how long people are prescribed it...",,
Rockingaround,Thu 23-Feb-17 01:00:41,"Thank you OP I think sometimes counselling, CBT and other therapies can help some people, although for many it's just too much, too painful and something many are never ready for/able to do. One of the things that has helped me, is to abandon looking for a resolve, I got to the point where I didn't care why I felt like ill, I just needed to feel better. I found that searching and the going over of my life in therapy just made things worse - I had several therapists - I think I got the point where I thought, even if I understand why I feel like this, I'm still going to feel like this so how do I make it go away. I initially started medication to give me a break from myself/the pain; with a view to get to the bottom of it when I felt stronger. 11 years on, I couldn't care if I never ""work through"" my issues and come to terms with why I have depression. It's quite an empowering place to be, I honestly don't think there's anything wrong with being on (the right) pills forever You sound like there's a lot going on for you at the moment. There's obviously those awful memories from the experiences you've had, the feelings they conjur up which are made worse by the very present effects of the breakdown of a relationship. One compounds the other, I'm terrible if faced with a difficult time, I group all of the bad things that have ever happened to me, along with my fears - together and become enveloped in all that sadness/hopelessness. (I think that's quite typical of a depressive thought process although I only know my experiences) Id be so overwhelmed in your position, by what's happening with your partner, which is bound to dredge up a lot of other negative feelings you've had in the past and it all just piles up too high. I would probably go and see the GP. Don't feel you have to pour your heart out, just tell him/her you have a good insight into your own mental health, you're having an excruciatingly difficult time and you're a mum and you need to feel better than you do. If you want to try and see if meds can give you a break maybe? it's exhausting feeling as you are right now. I think it takes about 3 weeks for an ssri to take effect ...",,

Saloire,Mon 13-Feb-17 02:11:28,"Sorry, a bit of a long post coming up:  So, I'm 32 weeks pregnant, due in April. I have a history of postnatal depression, plus winter depression which has recurred since my DD (now five years old) was born, and currently battle with insomnia. I'm not on any medication for any of these, but i'm not averse to it in the future.  So in December, my mum had a breakdown, and is relying on me relatively heavily for emotional support over the phone as I am 500 miles away so can't go to see her due to work and my daughter's school pick ups and drop-offs etc. Mum is currently on sertraline, and is also receiving CBT, but it doesn't seem to be making any difference. She phoned me today to say she felt suicidal and she just couldn't cope any more. I really don't know what to do to help her, and her whole demeanour plus the things she talks about are acting as a massive trigger for me. I hate seeing her like this, it makes me feel sad, makes me feel guilty for not being there, and it also makes me realise what I look like when I'm in that state, and I never want to go back there again. Of course the fear of all this is making me not sleep, which normally starts the cycle of anxiety for me. I've been bingeing on sugar to try and numb the anxious feelings, have been running away from doing anything remotely CBT or meditation related as it just reminds me of how it's not working for my mum. I've been trying to mask my feelings from my partner, so as not to make him feel like my mum is making me feel right now. I know he would be supportive, but I just don't want to cause him the same horrible feelings I get when I look at my mum.  I know I'm not helping myself, but I'm just a lost as to what to do and in what order. So, should I be phoning the doctor on my mum's behalf to tell him she's not getting any better and that she needs to up her dose of antidepressants, or should I be looking after myself first, admitting to my feelings and tackling my sugar addiction? My baby is due in under eight weeks, and I feel unprepared emotionally for what I know is to come. I feel I should be managing everything better in terms of looking after my mental health, and I know I'm not, there's just so much going on right now and I don't know where to start.

Sasha506,Mon 27-Jul-09 10:42:34,"I absolutely identify will all of the postings here. I wasn't at all sure that I wanted children. I had no experience of them as I was the youngest in the family (at 35!) My husband desperately wanted them, though and his mother and my mother deserately wanted grandchildren so I was made to feel like some sort of pariah for hesitating. I thought ""why not?"" and went ahead, then I found out why not. I had a daughter at 35 and another daughter at 37. They are now 21 and 19. I have photographs of us all as a family when they were 5 and 3 years old and I look as though I am suicidal, and I felt it too. My older daughter only became livable with when she left home and went to university, but she still comes home for extended stays in the holidays and we still clash like we always have. The main problems have been with my younger daughter who was born with mild learning difficulties. The problems have been catastrophic and still are. The only way I have survived this long is to keep working - I hung on to my job with my fingernails, even when most of my salary was going on nursery fees. My advice to anyone thinking about having children late in life is this - unless children mean the world to you, unless you think your life would not be complete without them and unless you can accept the complete loss of life as you knew it - dont do it!! And yes, if I could turn back the clock 22 years I wouldn't have done it, either.",,

I've had various informal diagnoses between anxiety and OCD in the past (although the best fit for my symptoms I've personally found is borderline) but nothing's stuck and I've usually managed to flit between services without getting sorted. I have moments of proper despair but by the time an appointment for anything comes around I'm coping a bit better and cancel, or feel like a fraud for sitting through the appointment, probably getting labelled a time waster  Despite (or perhaps because of) a couple of suicide attempts in my teens and self harm issues (although I've not cut in a few years and now just scratch myself) I can't see compulsive picking as a 'problem' in the same way. Family and friends just think of it as an irritating habit. When DP and I first met he used to bat my hands away when I started to pick until I told him how patronising I find it.

Shakey1500,Mon 02-Feb-15 19:58:25,"Bingesplodge and TheLondonerHello lovelies. I'm the poster who had the thunderbolt moment when DS was aged 4. I'll reiterate, I've never felt such relief over anything in my life and literally sank to my knees and wailed like a banshee.What's good is that you both have support from close family members/partner that are able to least share the load. I recall DH being away from home for 2 weeks and I was struggling massively, totally overwhelmed. Clock watching until bedtime till I could at least breathe on my own (and smoke copiously). My parents came one afternoon and whilst I thought I was plastering the right kind of smile on my face they must have seen right through me and offered to take DS overnight. The relief!DS is 8 this year and in all honesty, I know it seems like a distant lifetime away but time really has flown. I do still have pangs of yearning for my ""old"" life but it seems so far back that this life has morphed into me accepting that this is my life (if that makes sense) and I'll admit I sometimes often fantasise about retirement when I'll be totally able to do exactly as I please.TheLondoner You are right, it will come. And do you know why I think it will? Because I truly believe that if none of us really cared, we wouldn't bother to find threads like these to seek help, words of comfort, knowledge we're not alone. It's bloody hard, especially in the early years. I just had no option but to muddle through the fug, take each day/week/month at a time and wait for it to pass. There was no lead up to the thunderbolt, it just happened. Perhaps because I (thought I'd) reconciled myself to the fact I would always feel as despairing as I did. I wasn't trying, wasn't looking for it, I just ploughed through. But I'm mighty grateful it did and a huge burden has lifted. Keep ploughing, keep doing the best you can, even if you feel it's not enough, it is enough for now. We're none of us perfect, there are no guidelines, our emotions can overtake us sometimes, we will get there in our own time, in our own way. Because we're human. And it's totally ok to feel absolutely rotten about it and yearn backwards. As I often say, it's not wrong it's just...different.

SloanePeterson,Fri 17-Feb-17 08:36:11," Op, I want to tell you, the you of the future won't recognise the you of right now. The cbt and the tablets WILL help you. I was you 8 years ago. My second child was about 14 months old and I was falling apart, scared to leave the house but scared to stay in it, convinced that something truly awful was going to happen to me either way. I didn't open my post for over a year which caused all sorts of problems, I just shoved it all into a suitcase under my bed, so convinced that every letter would have terrible news in it. When I eventually did go to my gp I had to wait ten months for cbt, which helped enormously, and has helped me since too, it really helped me learn to handle life. Until that kicked in, I was prescribed some anti anxiety meds. I think j tried maybe here different ones before finding the one that was like a light being switched on. It worked. And tbh, ds is now diagnosed with autism, it's still a huge struggle every day, but I've never been back to those terrible depths of despair. I was surprised when my cbt therapist told me I had ocd. I was convinced that that meant obsessively cleaning. What it actually means is unhelpful, obtrusive, obsessive thoughts, which I had by the bucketful. This WILL pass. But you need to be honest with yourself and the people around you. I was a single parent, and had friends around who were aware of what I was struggling with and that really helped. I also had an awesome cbt therapist who knew I had no childcare and scheduled our sessions for when ds was most likely to nap, I'd walk the long way round to the surgery with him in his buggy and more often than not he'd be sound asleep when we got there. You don't have to put up with feeling like this. It isn't a weakness in you, and it's not something you asked for or deserve. It's just crappy thing that happens to some of us sometimes. Please at least try some tablets, if hey don't work then try some different ones. They saved my life.",,
slowreadingprogress,Sun 26-Jul-09 18:45:04,"Zahora, I really think that you need a revolution in your house. You are clearly either very depressed or utterly unsuited to be a full time mum. Nothing wrong with either of those things! What IS wrong is letting your child be brought up in that atmosphere (""ds is upset and holds me with terror saying 'mummy'"") I honestly think if your DH refuses to step in and take over that you could do something like sell up, downsize, rent - whatever it takes to get you able to leave the house and get him cared for by someone who wants to care for him. I think that's the best thing you could do for him and there is again, nothing wrong in the best person NOT being you. (in future, the best person may well be you, why the hell not? Kids change alot and as parents we all have strengths in different areas and at different times)the other thing that occurs to me is to write down for your GP what you have said about how you are with your ds. I am unqualified to say whether you are depressed or not but to be honest your doctor needs all the facts to make a proper diagnosis. If you can gird your loins to act now, I think the benefits will come to you in the future; happy you, happy ds....and again, it may take some loin-girding but your DH needs to HELP YOU!",,

tallie82,Mon 18-Jul-16 07:33:12," I have always liked drinking and have suffered with depression my whole life. 8 weeks ago my husband after years of manipulating and emotionally abusing me threatened to kill me and shoved me I tp a door so I had him arrested. This has left me alone with 2 Yong children (4&10m) and I a struggling to cope. I was drinking before he left and had several episodes as I Call them where I'd drink, go out and try (and sometimes succeed) to getting high on cocaine which caused massive strain on our relationship and I now feel this is all my fault. This weekend o have so e it all again, drank, some drugs, went back to some guys house and there was kissing etc (no sex thankfully) so I feel horribly guilty that I've cheated on my husband and he will never forgive me. He seems to be doing so well, seeing the kids at the weekend and working hard while I'm falling apart. He never gave a crap about the Kida when he was here so I think he has now realized what he done and wants to make amends. I still love him and want to try and work things out bit we can't talk as he is out bail and the conditions are no contact with me until the court case in September. I have bewwn to the doctors so many times but am going again today as I feel suicidal. I know this is all down to alcohol but I've tries to stop and I can't. I'm destroying y life, I feel so awful I can't look at my kids without crying and I just hate myself so much I self harmed at the weekend 2. Everything is such a Mess, my parents are very supportive but are at their witts end with me and so am I. I hate what I've become, o am like a different person hen I drink. I know some of it is to do with the medication I take for depression as it can make me hyper so I drink. I'm trying to come off them so I can go on something else . Sorry of this sound all over the place I'm just trying to get it all down. None of this is done around my kids although i have drank when they are up. I feel so low and hopeless I just want to end it all to stop the cycle. The only thing that stops me is my kids.",,
TENSHI,Thu 26-Jan-17 10:07:37,"Let me tell you something I did when overwhelmed, depressed and couldn't cope at all.I had young dc and a business. I preferred just to stuff any brown envelopes under the sofa or in a cupboard.One day I had a letter from the tax office asking to see my accounts of the last 3 years as part of a random survey. I can't tell you how much it threw me into a panic. I was unable to sleep and just ignored it. The next sequence of events remain hazy. I got a call from the tax office as I had failed to turn up to the meeting (I think). They asked me for my figures for the last year and I just plucked a figure out of thin air and told them.As I'm not sure the sequence of events, may be they asked to see me/the accounts.. well I knew I couldn't justify any of it so I just rang them up and confessed that I had just put a random figure down and actually had no idea what the real amount was as I didn't know and I was too upset to find out.They were absolutely marvellous. Told me not to worry, to gather all the paper work that I had and just bring it all in for them to sort out for me.I saw the kindliest lady and the kindliest fatherly sort of gentleman at the tax office in the next few weeks while they went through it all with me and told me next time I was struggling to just come in and ask for help. That they were trying to change the face of their work and it needn't be a scary place.So please don't despair as I did and put it off. Just confess and admit you're in a pickle/mess/overwhelmed/cannot cope and you will be surprised how your frankness and honesty will disarm people and you will see their compassionate side.Good luck ",,

My husband has been drinking heavily for about six months now, the most he drinks is on a Friday and that can be anything up to 12 cans of beer. He runs his own business and I suspect he's depressed as he's showing signs of that too, he often falls asleep on the sofa after drinking and gets up 20 minutes before he has to go to work, I sort the kids out every morning all by myself and I'm getting exhausted. He is becoming agitated with me too, he's not very supportive either and I just can't cope with him.Any advice on what I can do, would be highly appreciated.Thank you!",,
Turnip713,Tue 03-Aug-10 08:13:23,"I know this is politically incorrect advice, but if you keep looking at your suitcases and fantasizing about taking off, maybe you should. At least for a little while. What you're doing now isn't working for anyone, why not try something drastic? Things sound pretty drastic right now anyway. See if your husband can take the kid for a month or two or six, and go travel the world. Pack your bags and go to Paris or something. It may get the yearning for your old life out of your system. Maybe it'll give you perspective and you'll realize that you really do want to be a mother. Or maybe you'll realize that you never want to go back and you can reach a new arrangement with your husband. Maybe you could move out and take the kid on weekends and your husband could be the primary caregiver on weekdays? Your marriage (I know this sounds cynical) sounds like it's basically over anyway, so why not divorce and split custody? You can't give your child back, that is wrong, but turning into the worst version of yourself isn't going to do the kid any favors either, and you do sound kind of schizo(your words, not mine). Whichever you choose, time away would give you perspective and time to think, which it sounds like you desperately need. I don't think you're depressed. Depression is when you have a mental illness where even though nothing is wrong, you can't feel happy. It is usually accompanied by fatigue. You don't sound depressed, you sound genuinely unhappy. I'm actually not sure how qualified I am to give this advice since I'm not actually a mother. A big part of the reason I am not a mother is because the only reaction I can realistically imagine myself having to motherhood is exactly the one you've described above, right down to the feeling hollow part. Some people just aren't meant to be domesticated.",,

unlucky83,Thu 14-Jul-16 23:46:12,"I'm awaiting an appointment in Aug with psychiatry to get assessed and hopefully diagnosed. DD1 was diagnosed at just 14 - but I had suspected for years. I didn't want her labelled but with exams etc looming she was starting to lose it - I thought she was going to stop going to school (which is what I did). The medication transformed her school work. But there are 2 downsides - one she only takes it for school - when it wears off at night she becomes more lively than she was before - it is kind of like a release. And at the weekend/holidays she is also harder to deal with - more bouncy and loud than ever...and in some ways she controls it less as she has an excuse/reason - she isn't trying to be 'normal' any more. Which is probably better for her metal health... but can be a nightmare for me. She is also oppositional - you have to carefully phrase everything so she doesn't see it as an 'order' ... if she feels like you are telling her to do something she won't and the more cross you become with her the more she fights back. I'm 49 and going for a diagnosis cos I am struggling keeping on top of everything - I am the queen of procrastination...everything feels slightly out of control. I have seen what a difference medication made to DD and think if I took when I needed to I could get on top of everything for once and for all and feel happier. (I am back on ADs at the moment -struggled with depression all my life and was suicidal when I was in my 20s)I am addicted to coffee and nicotine - although I vape now on the whole - only have the odd cigarette. I cry when I haven't had a cigarette for a while - I panic and feel like I can't function. I read Allan carrs book about stopping smoking - in it he says remember how awful that first cigarette made you feel - my first cigarette made me feel great . The same is true for coffee - I drink gallons of super strong coffee every day and I really can't function without it. I then read both nicotine and caffeine have been trialled as treatments for ADHD...which was a real ahhhh I get it moment for me -before that I just thought I had an addictive personality. I only took E a couple of times (I became ill and was on serious prescription drugs when I was into that scene - so then couldn't risk it or any other illegal drugs) and it made my brain feel so focused - it was amazing - everything was so clear - I wasn't buzzing I was just super calm and together...I kind of thought that is how it made everyone feel  Only took cocaine once and it had no real noticeable effect on me...that I can remember. I'm still on prescription medication and have dodgy health so daren't risk sneaking some of DD's concerta -although I have been tempted. As to fidgeting - an acquaintance apparently thought I was an addict cos I was so fidgety, keep touching my face etc. But I have developed a technique to stop me being too fidgety. I also think DP has ADHD (doing the questionnaire for DD was when the penny dropped). The other day we were watching a (slightly tedious) school concert. He can't sit still- rocks around on his chair, wriggles, his legs are bouncing etc. I realised to all outward appearance I was sitting still - I cross my arms and legs to stop me fidgeting - but I am wriggling my toes like mad in my shoes....",,
unlucky83,Wed 23-Nov-16 18:55:35,"I'm just reporting back on my assessment. The first appt I was gutted - he told me it sounded like normal difficulties etc and I could never have achieved what I have if I had it ...I had been trying to be calm and factual - like I said I didn't think it would be a battle. We seemed to be talking at cross purposes a lot - I was suicidally depressed in my 20s - he picked up I never attempted suicide I was never an inpatient - although my counsellor did ask me if I thought I needed to (I couldn't afford to!) etc etc. He definitely didn't think that I had been suicidal ...when I was (if that makes sense). Anyway my impulsive side came out and I went into a rant of how they missed DD1 until she 14 because she was bright - and just because I am bright so I have strategies etc so I am not in pieces doesn't mean I don't find things really really hard. And my mental health suffers cos I feel like a constant failure and am constantly forcing myself to be focused and in control etc etc. He said he'd see me again for a follow up...I left in a mess - pressed the self destruct button - and drove like a maniac home in tears -thinking I don't care any more - I need help and I'm not getting it.  Went back to the GP to tell her about it and she basically said maybe I had built it up too much in my head etc...go to the next appt viewing it as a clean slate.Next time I went with 2 A4 sides of my life history - started by apologising for being stroppy and went through everything I thought he'd misunderstood. Also he was worried about my mood -I was very low (not surprising I think...) - at the end he said it sounded like ADHD but he would have to have a chat with someone about me... So been back today ...really wound up about it - not sure how I would cope if it was a negative....anyway - drum roll- I now have an ADHD diagnosis. Will be starting meds after health checks - and actually don't know how I feel. I am exhausted. I feel happy - I guess relief that I am not just crap at life. But also sad about how much wasted ...everything ...where I would be if I had had a diagnosis as a child...how much easier things would have been. I am on the verge of tears ...not sure why - I think it is just relief... I know medication isn't a cure - but I am really hoping they help. (I'm quite excited about it - somewhere on a thread someone mentioned taking ecstasy - I took it twice in my 20s ( before I was physically ill and on serious medication that I couldn't mix with illegal drugs) For me it made everything so calm and clear, so peaceful - I'm hoping medication is a bit like that...",,

Used2bthin,Mon 30-Jan-17 22:47:53,I'm really unsure as to what to do. I'm on 20mg fluoxetine. Tried citalopram and sertraline too and all make me gain weight for whatever reason. Not just eating more but seems to be a basic change to my metabolism too as I lost weight when off them but find it hard to cope without them due to anxiety.I think I am quite depressed at the moment and my dh has mentioned to me this eve that I'm starting to avoid leaving the house etc again.. part of this for me is I think this at the tablets help my anxiety but then I stop obsessing over little things and get depressed about the big (unfortunately real) stuff. The weight gain is also a big factor though as I don't feel like me. The question is do I go up higher and take 40mg or would that increase my likelihood of gaining even more weight?

Last year sometime he started getting nasty if I pissed him off. Saying things like I just wish you'd fuck off and die, drop dead you cunt, you look like a man, you're a retard and you don't even love our son. I thought I could stick around as if I leave his dad I'd be moving 300 miles away to where I'm originally from. I just don't want my son growing up without a father. I'm starting to think now that it's really affecting my son. When his dad is home (he works away and or really long hours) my son plays up. He doesn't want to go to sleep and is constantly trying to get attention. His dad has no qualms about shouting and being angry in front of our son. He accuses me of trying to cheat on him and I'm basically confined to our house. I don't drive and can't really have friends around as he gets really annoyed. I feel so stuck here. I've never had any help or a break from my son. .

Viewofhedges,Mon 22-Feb-16 16:24:42,Hello Cornwall. There haven't been many posters on here for a while but I've seen your messages and wanted to reach out with a hug. We're in very different positions - I was due to start IVF in January but after crying snottily down the phone at the nurse we panicked and pulled out. I'm now back on the thinking about it and feeling every day slip past (I'm 39 now) and not knowing if we're having a lucky escape or missing out on something amazing. I don't know if I'll ever know.For what it's worth I think you're in a very difficult situation and I'm not surprised you're struggling. I can't begin to imagine how hard twins must be and how hard it must be to have a partner who doesn't want kids. (My DH and I are similarly torn which means it's hard to decide but at least we're as hopeless as each other). It's a real shame that your DH can't step up and interact with his own family. Great that you can afford a Nanny though and I hope you can use that resource to give yourself some time to rest and breathe. I hope you can find some support in IRL. Are there any twins support networks you can join? My friend had twins and a toddler and I'm surprised she didn't collapse (I went to help her a few times but when she told me to 'just get a dog' when we couldn't have kids and were trying to figure that out in our minds we stopped talking. But now both DH and I really want a dog!) I really do send you as much support as possible over the internet and hope that as they grow you will experience some of the joy that's supposed to come with kids.,,

I was put onto fluoxetine at 14 for about a year.. my parents (my mother) didn't know what to do with me, I was in and out of hospital, didn't finish school and was sent to live with grandparents...Through a stroke of luck I met my husband and started to build my life, we fell pregnant with my now 9yo son... after he was born I had severe PND, I was referred and saw a counsellor but was told i could only have one session, I think that set off my dislike of mental health support on the NHS, how I feel towards my son is different compared to my younger 2, he has high functioning autism which I know is my fault and my inability to love him as I know I should since birth... I do love him of course but I don't feel like I know him and often wish my husband would leave me and take my eldest with him... I didn't feel like this with my younger two but it I did notice the difference in how I felt about my eldest- I took myself to the Drs and was told to call samaritans... I went back and was given an appointment for talking mental health Derbyshire, that appointment was cancelled on the morning I was due to go and they couldn't offer me another one at the time. So I've spent the last year just plodding along.Here and now after my periods returned in the summer and my husband had the snip last year I've noticed that my monthly severe depression is back, I've been using an app to track my moods and cycles, I feel suicidal in the week or so leading up to my period, my mood settles somewhat but still extremely anxious and easily wound up... it looks like premenstrual dysphoric disorder is what has been my problem for the past 14 years, but how do I go about getting help, do I ask for help treating that in hope it will tie in the on going pnd and the lack of bond I have with my eldest?

WindfallenArch,Tue 04-Oct-16 13:36:50," Everything really is as bad as I think it is - I don't think it's catastrophic thinking - I really am unemployable, friendless and skint. I see no end to it. I'm simultaneously skilless and overqualified so have no idea what to do to get some work to at least have a reason to get out of bed and wash. My family are all dead, my children have recently reached the stage where I embarrass them - they were my world and gave me a reason to live. My marriage is an empty shell. I have nothing and no one. I therefore wonder if there is anything wrong with my mental health at all - I may just be perfectly reasonably hopeless.",,
WindfallenArch,Wed 05-Oct-16 17:05:24," Well on paper I look like I was doing ok, so it looks like I should be able to get a job to anyone that sees my CV. Qualifications left right and centre. It's all bullshit though - I was in IT. I'm now so hopelessly deskilled after time with the kids that I may as well never have done it. It's a lifetime ago and I was only ever mediocre even pre kids. I somehow clung on - partly I suspect for positive discrimination reasons. I was the only woman in the room and it helped the stats.",,
Wolfiefan,Wed 22-Feb-17 23:11:34, Yep. Depression. Functioning. Wading through treacle. Detached and robotic. Totally was depression for me. I thought it couldn't be. I didn't feel sad. I had nothing to be depressed about. But yep I was depressed.,,
Woollymammoth63,Sun 19-Feb-17 15:08:38," Ho Pollyanna sorry to hear you are feeling so anxious. It's horrible and I have been there. GPs are not MH experts and some are better than others in terms of their understanding and communication. In terms of diazepam, it can be given short term in patients considered safe physically ( not at risk eg pneumonia) , not interacting with other medications, and short term relief only, and in someone who is not suicidal.it is risky as diazepam etc are addictive, and can cause depression of breathing etc. so it is at the individual GPs discretion if he feels this is safe, and a good idea. Alternative might be an antidepressant , but again a check that the person is not suicidal, and letting them know that Ads can (but don't always )make these feelings worse, usually for a few weeks in which case to immediately seek medical help. I would think see what they say, you don't have to wait for a routine appt, you can ask for the on call doctor, who usually will call you back and then probably ask to see you. It's tricky, but I would think counselling/ CBT would help , I would think it worth considering to go along with the mental health team counselling referral. Have you looked at online mindfulness, mood juice, no panic, Mind website, I think there might be a MInd helpline, and the Samaritans. Don't despair, this will improve, you will get help, but if you feel you need urgent help go through AE or out of hours GP who will get you the crisis team or AE. The GP can refer you direct to the crisis team if he felt you were in distress, it's really best to be honest and discuss with him/ her. All the best",,
Wriggler79,Tue 23-Aug-16 06:49:07,"Hi, ok if I join? I'm 36, got diagnosed at age 32 after battling past a GP who told me I was depressed, and a psychologist who thought I might have ASD despite me waving Delivered From Distraction at her. Diagnosed at Wakefield, put on Equasym and now gradually improving my life. Had to go to CBT for confidence and self esteem which worked far better than I expected. Left my EA husband and now trying to get a better career. Learned to drive before meds; meds help so much! I struggle with social stuff; not good at remembering birthdays etc, have a general downer on myself and think I witter on and am boring (I do the 'life story' thing!). Have had a look through this thread and downloaded a timer as have some paperwork to do urgently today!",,

xoasemarald,Tue 21-Feb-17 15:46:52,"I really don't know what to do :/My DH was diagnosed azoopsermic in October, the news came as a huge blow to him. he is currently on anti-depressants, is supposed to be doing an online CBT course and having counselling sessions. He has had 2 or 3 phone appointments with a counsellor, and has access to services 24hrs a day, where he can ring in and get support.He's been having suicidal thoughts. He's been signed off work with stress and is currently moping about doing not much, despite seemingly being positive about some jobs he has to do around the house to keep him busy.Basically, I fell like I'm getting no support for this - on a few levels 1) acknowledging/accepting that we might not have children, if he doesn't come round to the idea of sperm donor/adoption, which won't happen for along time if his mental health is low. (I'm just turned 34, tick tock...) it's HARD2) No support about how to cope with a depressed spouse that at times is suicidal3) no support for 'me' and how this is affecting me. I feel like crying all the time.",,

I gave in after so many rows thinking I would adjust. It was either that or leave my husband whom I loved very much. My son is 2 years old and it has been such a lonely and desperate struggle. I feel like my wonderful life has turned upside down. I still do not feel like a mother. I look after my son full time, I even breastfed for a year, yet it just feels so ...hollow. It's not me. I miss my old life so much I just feel like walking out and leaving my husband and son. I hate playing in the park. I want to go to a gallery. I hate watching peppa pig- I want to read a novel. I hate going to playgroups - I want to have lunch with freinds. I do everything I can for my son and he is lovely. Yet motherhood so far has left me feeling like I have been conned out of my real life. Will life ever return to normal. Will my son feel that I am detached? I don't think I'm depressed.

Zahora,Thu 02-Jul-09 01:06:15,In the past it's been worse. I had been to the doc and said I am depressed. The doctor said I wasn't. maybe v.mild I got some citalopram or something which seems to numb me a little. But I find myself withdrawn more with them.,,
